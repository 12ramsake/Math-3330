    "text": "1.1.1 The main question\nThe whole course is concerned with the following problem: Suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are some attributes of a population. What is the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). How can we use \\(X\\) to predict \\(Y\\), or how can we use \\(X\\) to explain \\(Y\\)?\nFor example, questions of this form include:\n\nHow is location, square feet, parking available related to the price of an Airbnb?\nHow is hours played and age related to win rate in League of Legends?\nHow are creatine and protein consumption related to deadlift 1RM?\nHow is treatment (A or B) related to pain levels of patients?\n\nAll of these can be answered with regression!\n\nExercise 1.1 What is \\(X\\) and what is \\(Y\\) here?\n\n\nSolution 1.1. \n\n\\(X\\): location, square feet, parking available \\(Y\\): price of an Airbnb\n\\(X\\): hours played and age \\(Y\\): win rate in League of Legends\n\\(X\\): creatine and protein consumption \\(Y\\): deadlift 1RM\n\\(X\\): treatment (A or B) \\(Y\\): pain levels of patients\n\n\nWe suppose at the population level, on average that \\(Y=f(X).\\) By on average, we mean that each person may not have exactly \\(Y=f(X),\\), but if we we average out \\(Y\\) for many people, we will have that the average is approximately \\(f(X)\\). (This will be made more formal later).\nFor instance, consider the pain level question in the above example. Suppose that \\(f(A)=2\\) and \\(f(B)=5\\). Then, if we average the pain level of many patients who take treatment \\(B\\), it should be close to 5.\nObviously, we cannot observe the whole population, and so we will assume that we have observed \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for a set of \\(n\\) individuals. Specifically, we observe some outcome \\(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n\\), which is a real number and some attributes (categorical or numeric) about the \\(n\\) individuals, denoted by \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\). Note that here \\(X_i\\) can be vectors or single numbers.\n\n\n1.1.2 Using our data, how can we determine \\(f\\)?\nOther, related questions:\n\nWhat is the form of \\(f\\)? Is it linear?\nHow can we estimate \\(f\\), say with \\(\\hat f\\)? What is the best \\(\\hat f\\)? What is the error of \\(\\hat f\\) on average?\nHow can we tell if our model is good? i.e. how does \\(\\hat f\\) fit the data?\nHow can we tell which \\(X\\) values are important? How can we tell if \\(X\\) is related to \\(Y\\) at all?\nWhat is the effect of correlation of \\(X\\) values?\n\nThese are all questions we will answer in this course.\nStatistical modelling starts as follows:\n\nQuestion about a population, e.g., “How are hours played and age related to win rate in League of Legends?”\nData: \\((Y_1,X_1),\\ldots,(Y_n,X_n)\\)\nExplore data with graphs and summary stats\nUse exploratory data analysis to posit a model for the population.\n\nNote that step 4 is necessary! Letting \\(f\\) be anything is too general and won’t work well, so we need to use the data to give us a hint at the form of \\(f\\)! For instance, we might suppose that \\(f\\) is a linear function! That is, \\(f\\in \\{g(X)=X\\beta\\colon \\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^d\\}\\).\nNext, we proceed with the following steps:\n\nEstimation: How to get an estimate \\(\\hat\\beta\\) of \\(\\beta\\)?\nInference: What is the error of \\(\\hat\\beta\\)? Is \\(f\\) degenerate? I.e., is \\(\\beta=0\\)?\nFit: Does our fitted line match up with the data? What about the normality assumption? Do the errors appear normal?\nPrediction: Predict any values if necessary.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Comparison with means example\nLet’s compare to what we learned in previous statistics courses about two sample testing with the above steps in mind. Below we have different hours of extra sleep for two different treatments. Let’s see if the sleep for groups 1 and 2 differ.\n\nDo the counts for A and B differ?\n\n\n# 2. \ndata('sleep')\nhead(sleep)\n\n  extra group ID\n1   0.7     1  1\n2  -1.6     1  2\n3  -0.2     1  3\n4  -1.2     1  4\n5  -0.1     1  5\n6   3.4     1  6\n\n# 3. \naggregate(extra ~ group, data = sleep, FUN = function(x){hist(x,main=names(x))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in format.data.frame(if (omit) x[seq_len(n0), , drop = FALSE] else x, :\ncorrupt data frame: columns will be truncated or padded with NAs\n\n\n  group                   extra\n1     1   -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n2     2 -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nsummary_stats = aggregate(extra ~ group, data = sleep,  FUN = summary)\nprint(summary_stats)\n\n  group extra.Min. extra.1st Qu. extra.Median extra.Mean extra.3rd Qu.\n1     1     -1.600        -0.175        0.350      0.750         1.700\n2     2     -0.100         0.875        1.750      2.330         4.150\n  extra.Max.\n1      3.700\n2      5.500\n\naggregate(extra ~ group, data = sleep, FUN = length)\n\n  group extra\n1     1    10\n2     2    10\n\n\nWe will assume that the extra hours are normal from the histograms.\nRecall then that the pooled standard deviation is \\(\\hat\\sigma_p=\\sqrt{((n_x-1)\\hat \\sigma_x^2+(n_y-1)\\hat \\sigma_y^2)\\big/ (n_x+n_y-2)}\\) and the test statistic is: \\[T=\\frac{\\bar X-\\bar Y}{\\hat\\sigma_p\\times\\sqrt{1/n_x+1/n_y}}.\\] In addition, we have that \\(T\\sim t_{n_x+n_y-2}\\).\n\n# 5 and 6 - here these steps are the same, since we are only doing inference\nt.test(sleep$extra[sleep$group==1],sleep$extra[sleep$group==2])\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1] and sleep$extra[sleep$group == 2]\nt = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.07939\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -3.3654832  0.2054832\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n     0.75      2.33 \n\n# 7 - we checked normality earlier, 8 is not applicable\n\nHere, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and there is not enough evidence to suggest that there is a different between the groups.

That is, \\(f\\) takes a value from \\(A\\) and outputs some value in \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\colon \\Omega\\rightarrow S\\) where \\(S\\) is countable, then \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable\nWe say \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable if \\(\\Pr(X=r)=0\\) for all \\(r\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).\nOtherwise, \\(X\\) is a mixed random variable (which we won’t worry about in this course)\n\n\n2.1.1 Discrete Random Variables\nIf \\(X\\colon \\Omega\\rightarrow S\\) where \\(S\\) is countable, then \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable. \\(S\\) can be finite, but can also be any infinite subset of the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The distribution of \\(X\\) is given by its PMF, denoted by \\(f(x)\\). For any \\(x\\in S\\), \\(f(x)=\\Pr(X=x)\\). (Note that ‘\\(\\in\\)’ means the word “in”.)\nWe must have that:\n\n\\(\\sum_{x\\in S}f(x)=1\\), (This notation means summing over all the elements in \\(S\\).)\n\\(\\forall x\\in S\\), \\(0\\leq f(x)\\leq 1\\). (This notation means for all \\(x\\) in \\(S\\), \\(0\\leq f(x)\\leq 1\\).)\n\nExamples: Binomial random variables, Poisson random variables and Geometric random variables are all discrete random variables.\n\nExercise 2.1 What is the PMF of a Binomial random variable? Can two different random variables have the same PMF? Why or why not?\n\n\nSolution 2.1. First: \\(\\Pr\\left(X=x\\right)\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\\) Second: Yes. Two random variables can be different random variables, but have the same distribution.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Continuous Random Variables\nWe say \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable if \\(\\Pr(X=r)=0\\) for all \\(r\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). If \\(X\\colon \\Omega\\rightarrow S\\) and \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable, then \\(S\\) is typically the real numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), but can be any uncountable subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The distribution of \\(X\\) is given by the PDF \\(f(x)\\). For any interval \\((a,b)\\subset\\in S\\), \\(\\Pr(X\\in (a,b))=\\int_a^b f(x)dx\\).\nWe must have that:\n\n\\(\\int_{- \\infty}^\\infty f(x)dx=1\\),\n\\(\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\(f(x)\\geq 0\\).\n\nExamples: Normal random variables, Chi-squared random variables, \\(t\\) random variables, Cauchy random variables, \\(F\\) random variables are all continuous random variables. Generally, we will focus on continuous random variables.\n\nExercise 2.2 What is the PMF of a Normal random variable?\n\n\nSolution 2.2. \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}\\)\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Properties of Random Variables\nLet \\(X,X_1,X_2\\) be random variables.\nRecall the important quantities \\(\\mathrm{E}{X}\\), \\(\\mathrm{var}{X}\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}(X_1,X_2)\\), \\(\\mathrm{corr}(X_1,X_2)\\). Recall expectation:\n\nDefinition 2.2 The expectation of a random variable \\(X\\) is \\[\\mathrm{E}{X}=\\sum_{x\\in S}x\\Pr\\left(X=x\\right),\\] if \\(X\\) is discrete and is \\[\\mathrm{E}{X}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)dx,\\] if \\(X\\) is continuous.\n\nThis is the ``average’’ value of the random variable. Note that it is possible for it to be impossible for \\(X=\\mathrm{E}{X}\\). Try to come up with an example of this!\n\nDefinition 2.3 The variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is \\[{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[X\\right]={\\textrm{E}}\\left[|X-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right]|^2\\right]=\\sum_{x\\in S}(x-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right])^2\\Pr\\left(X=x\\right),\\] if \\(X\\) is discrete and is \\[{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[X\\right]={\\textrm{E}}\\left[|X-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right]|^2\\right]=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right])^2f(x)dx,\\] if \\(X\\) is continuous.\n\nThe variance describes the variation of \\(X\\) about its mean. In other words, it describes on ``average’’, how far is \\(X\\) from its mean.\n\nDefinition 2.4 The covariance between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[{\\textrm{cov}}\\left[X,Y\\right]={\\textrm{E}}\\left[(X-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right])(Y-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y\\right])\\right].\\]\n\nThe covariance describes the unnormalised linear association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\nDefinition 2.5 The correlation between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\[{\\textrm{corr}}\\left[X,Y\\right]={\\textrm{cov}}\\left[X,Y\\right]/\\sqrt{{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[X\\right]{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y\\right]}.\\]\n\nThe correlation describes the normalized linear association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nNext, recall that for a random variable \\(X\\), its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by \\(F_X(x)=\\Pr\\left(X\\leq x\\right)\\). The joint CDF of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is given by \\(F_{XY}(x,y)=\\Pr\\left(X\\leq x, Y\\leq y\\right)\\).\nLastly, for a vector of \\(d\\) random variables \\(\\mathbf{X}=(X_1,\\ldots,X_d)\\), let its CDF by \\(F_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\Pr\\left(X_1\\leq x_1,\\ldots X_d\\leq x_d\\right)\\), where here \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_d)\\).\nWe next present the concept of independence of random variables. Let \\(F_{XY}(x,y)\\) be the joint CDF of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and let \\(F_X\\) and \\(F_Y\\) be the univariate CDFs of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. For two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if \\(F_{XY}(x,y)=F_X(x)F_Y(y)\\). More generally, two vectors of random variables \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) are independent if \\(F_{(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y})}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})=F_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{x})F_{\\mathbf{Y}}(\\mathbf{y})\\), where \\(F_{(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y})}\\) is the CDF of the vector \\((\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y})\\). A set of random variables \\(\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\) are mutually independent if for any two mutually exclusive subsets of \\(\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\) are also independent. Note that we write \\(X \\perp Y\\) if \\(X\\) is independent of \\(Y\\).\nWe have that:\n\nTheorem 2.1 The following holds:\n\n\\(X_1\\perp X_2 \\implies {\\textrm{E}}\\left[X_1 X_2\\right]={\\textrm{E}}\\left[X_1\\right]{\\textrm{E}}\\left[X_2\\right]\\)\n\\(X_1\\perp X_2 \\implies {\\textrm{corr}}\\left[X_1,X_2\\right]=0\\)\n\\({\\textrm{corr}}\\left[X_1,X_2\\right]=0\\) does not imply \\(X_1\\perp X_2\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Prove Theorem 2.1 .\n\nLet \\(X,X_1,X_2,\\ldots X_n\\) be random variables. Recall the linearity of expectation property:\n\nTheorem 2.2 For \\(a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), it holds that \\(\\mathrm{E}{aX+b}=a\\mathrm{E}{X}+b\\).\n\n\nExercise 2.4 Prove Theorem 2.2 .\n\nAs a corollary of Theorem 2.2 , we have that\n\n\\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i{\\textrm{E}}\\left[ X_i\\right]\\)\n\\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[ X_i\\right]+\\sum_{i\\neq j}a_ia_j{\\textrm{cov}}\\left[X_i,X_j\\right]\\)\n\\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[aX_1+bX_2+c\\right]=a^2\\mathrm{var}{X_1}+b^2{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[X_2\\right]+2ab{\\textrm{cov}}\\left[X_1,X_2\\right]\\)\n\n\nExercise 2.5 What happens to \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[aX_1+bX_2+c\\right]\\) when \\(\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\) are mutually independent?\n\n\nExercise 2.6 Let \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots X_n\\) be i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) random variables with expectation (also known as mean) \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). What is the expectation and variance of \\[\\bar X=\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i/n?.\\]\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Useful properties of normal and related random variables\nLet\n\n\\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) represent the normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\\(\\chi^2_k\\) be the Chi-squared distribution with \\(k\\) degrees of freedom\n\\(t_n\\) be the student-\\(t\\) distribution with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom\n\\(F_{m,n}\\) be the \\(F\\) distribution with \\(m\\) numerator degrees of freedom and \\(n\\) denominator degrees of freedom\n\nWe have the following results:\n\nTheorem 2.3 Suppose that \\(X\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then\n\n\\(Z=\\frac{X- \\mu}{\\sigma}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\)\n\\(Z^2\\sim \\chi^2_1\\).\n\n\nLet \\([n]=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\).

    "section": "2.2 Review of introductory statistics",
    "text": "2.2 Review of introductory statistics\nThe followings are some concepts that you have learned from prerequisites, and/or we have reviewed in the last two lectures.\n\nSample vs. Population\nObservation vs. Random variable\nStatistic vs. Parameter\nEstimate vs. Estimator\nEstimator is a random variable and estimate is a number calculated from data\nMean and variance of random variable\nRelationships between Normal, \\(t\\) , \\(\\chi^2\\), \\(F\\) etc.\n\n\n2.2.1 Basic premise of statistics\nThe whole purpose of statistics is to learn something about a population using only a sample of units from that population. A sample is a smaller, typically randomly selected, subset of a population. A population is a collection of units which we would like to know something about. For example, we may collect a sample of hamburgers from McDonald’s if we want to learn something about the population of McDonald’s hamburgers.\nIn general, at least for this course, we assume that we have access to a sample of units from a given population. Furthermore, we assume that that sample is a random sample. Specifically, we assume that these units in the sample are realizations of random variables. In addition, we also assume that these random variables are mutually independent. For example, we could assume that our sample \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\) is Normally distributed with some fixed mean \\(\\mu\\) and fixed variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). In this case, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are unknown parameters of the population. A parameter of a population is some quantity that is a function of the distribution of our given sample. For instance, \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[X_i\\right]=\\mu\\). Generally, we are concerned with unknown population parameters, which are parts of the distribution that are unknown, and can only ever be estimated. For example, we may know our data is normal, but not know the mean parameter. In that case, we need to use an estimate of the parameter. We use a function of the data, typically called the estimator, say \\(T\\), which produces the estimate, given by \\(T\\) computed at the sample we observed: \\(T(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)\\).\nFor example, to estimate \\(\\mu\\), we typically use the sample mean. Here, the estimate is given by \\(\\bar X=\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i/n\\). To be specific, the estimate is the value of \\(\\bar X\\) and the estimator \\(T\\) is the function that maps \\(n\\) real numbers to their mean. In general, estimates are used to give our `best guess’ at population parameters.\n\n\n2.2.2 Confidence intervals\nRecall from the previous section that our estimate of a parameter is only that, an estimate. In other words, it is not exactly equal to the population parameter. For instance, if we drew a different sample our estimate would change. A confidence interval is used to acknowledge this phenomenon in the reporting of our statistics. Its used to give a range of estimates that we might have obtained from any “regular” sample we might observe. It is ultimately used to quantify the error (sometimes called uncertainty) in our estimate.\nConfidence intervals consist of a level, usually denoted by \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) and two end points. For example, you have learned confidence intervals for the population mean. When we say \\((-1,1)\\) is \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the population mean, what does this mean? Colloquially, it means that we expect the sample mean to be somewhere within \\((-1,1)\\) with high confidence. Note that confidence intervals are computed from the data, which means also that for each new sample, we would get a different confidence interval. However, the population parameter never changes. Therefore, the interval is what is varying from sample to sample. This impacts the interpretation of a confidence interval.\nContinuing our example, we have that the interval \\((-1,1)\\) can be interpreted as: “if we drew many more samples, 95% of the intervals will contain the population parameter.” We do not say that the parameter has a 95% chance of falling in (-1,1), since the parameter is not random, the interval end points are.\nFor example, we have the formula for a confidence interval for the population mean is given by: \\(\\bar X\\pm 1.96\\hat\\sigma\\). Notice that it is based only on the data. Therefore, it will change if we drew a new sample.\nTo summarize this section, a confidence interval is used to quantify the uncertainty in our reported estimates. By uncertainty, we specifically mean the uncertainty resulting from the fact that we have only a sample of the population, and our estimate varies depending on the sample.\n\n\n2.2.3 Hypothesis tests\nHypothesis tests are used to determine whether an effect is spurious or a real property of the population. A spurious effect is one that is specific to the sample we observed, and is not a real property of the population. For example, if the heights of males and female students are measured, and we observe that the sample mean of both male and females are equal, then this would be a spurious effect. We know that the population heights of males and females are substantially different. If we drew a new sample, we would likely observe something that mirrors the population reality (provided it is large enough).\nFormally, a hypothesis test compares two competing beliefs about a population parameter, called the null and alternative hypothesis. For instance, we may wish to test whether the population heights of men is greater than women, vs. the heights being less than or equal to that of men.\nWe write this as follows: \\(H_0\\colon \\mu_{men}\\leq \\mu_{women}\\) vs. \\(H_a\\colon \\mu_{men}&gt; \\mu_{women}\\).\n\nThe null hypothesis is usually chosen to be one such that if we make a mistake, the error is most serious. However, it is usually clear from the context.\n\nIn general, we compute a test statistic and its distribution under the null hypothesis. Then we compute how likely it was to see the observed test statistic we saw, if the null hypothesis was true. This likelihood is given by the p-value. If it was sufficiently unlikely (in other words, the p-value is less than the threshold \\(\\alpha\\)), then we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis then either the null hypothesis is true, it is not true, but there was not enough data collected to show the effect.\nThere are two types of errors we can make in a hypothesis test: Type 1 and Type 2 error. Type one error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is true. Type two error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is true.\nLet’s do an example.\n\nExercise 2.7 In a study about online dating, you are interested in determining the average age of individuals who use online dating platforms. You want to know whether the average age of online daters is significantly different from 30. You have a dataset of 40 ages of people using online dating platforms.\n\nHow would you answer this question?\n\\[H_0\\colon \\mu=30\\qquad vs. \\qquad H_1\\colon \\mu\\neq 30.\\]\nFirst, we can explore the data:\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/12RAM/OneDrive - York University/Teaching/Courses/Math 3330 Regression/Math 3330 Notes\"\n\nages=read.csv('C:\\\\Users\\\\12RAM\\\\OneDrive - York University\\\\Teaching\\\\Courses\\\\Math 3330 Regression\\\\Lecture Codes\\\\Data\\\\dating_ages.csv')[,2]\n\n\n\nhist(ages,freq=F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume that \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_{40}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), and independent. (We can justify normality with the histogram, or we could also invoke the CLT to get normality of the sample mean (not the data itself).) Therefore, we can do a one sample \\(t\\)-test. Recall that, under the null hypothesis, we have \\(\\frac{\\bar X-30}{\\hat\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\sim t_{n-1}\\). This means that if \\(\\left|\\frac{\\bar X-30}{\\hat\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right|\\geq t_{n-1,1-\\alpha/2}\\), then we reject the null hypothesis! Here, \\(t_{n-1,1-p}\\) is the \\((1-p)\\)th quantile of the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution. For large \\(n\\) and \\(p=0.025\\), this is roughly equal to 2.\nNow, recall that \\[ H_0\\colon \\mu=30\\qquad vs. \\qquad H_1\\colon \\mu\\neq 30 \\] We have that \\(\\left|\\frac{\\bar X-30}{\\hat\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right|=66.234\\). Using R, we get that the p-value is \\(&lt; 2.2\\times 10^{-16}\\).\n\n# Calculate the mean of the 'ages' data and assign it to xbar\nxbar = mean(ages)\nxbar  # Print the mean\n\n[1] 28.16378\n\n# Calculate the variance of the 'ages' data and assign it to ssq\nssq = var(ages)\nssq  # Print the variance\n\n[1] 1.277377\n\n# Calculate the length (number of observations) of the 'ages' data and assign it to n\nn = length(ages)\nn  # Print the number of observations\n\n[1] 40\n\n# Set the significance level \nalpha = 0.05\n\n# Perform a two-sided t-test to check if the mean of 'ages' is significantly different from 30\n# t.test() is the function for performing t-tests in R\ntest = t.test(ages, mu = 30, alternative = 'two.sided')\ntest  # Print the test result\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  ages\nt = -10.275, df = 39, p-value = 1.179e-12\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 30\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 27.80232 28.52524\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 28.16378 \n\n\nHere the p-value measures how much evidence there is against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is very small, then this constitutes strong evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is small, but closer to 0.05, then there is evidence against the null. If it is larger, but still small, say 0.1, then this is weak evidence against the null hypothesis. It is not helpful to throw it away if it is above 0.05, therefore we should not just take \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Choosing \\(\\alpha\\) depends on how serious a type 1 error is. If it is not that serious, we can take \\(\\alpha\\) larger. If it is very serious, we can take \\(\\alpha\\) smaller.\nIn this example, there is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote also that we can use the confidence interval method with \\[ \\bar X\\pm t_{n-1,1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma^2/n}.\\]\n\n\n\n# Alternative method to calculate the confidence interval\n# ci will store the confidence interval values\nci = xbar + c(-1, 1) * qt(1 - alpha / 2, n - 1) * sqrt(ssq / n)\nci  # Print the confidence interval\n\n[1] 27.80232 28.52524\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoving beyond the one-sample testing problem, we might be interested in other population parameters, say \\(\\theta\\in \\Theta\\). Think Lecture 1: \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]=\\beta_0+X\\beta_1\\), we might want to estimate \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]\\), which amounts to \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1\\in \\mathbb{R}\\)! In general, we may estimate \\(\\theta\\) by \\(\\hat\\theta\\). Then we may compute the variance and distribution of \\(\\hat\\theta\\). From there, we can make confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests etc.\n\n\nLet’s do another example:\n\nExercise 2.8 In a study about online dating, you are interested in determining if the average age of those who identify as men who use online dating platforms differs from those who identify as women. You have a dataset of 20 ages of each group using online dating platforms.\n\nWhat is the population parameter of interest here? It is \\(\\Delta=\\mu_{1}-\\mu_2\\), the difference in means between the two populations. Now, suppose that \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_{20}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_{20}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma^2)\\), and are mutually independent. (We could also invoke the CLT instead of assuming normality.) We can estimate those parameters with estimates. For instance, \\(\\bar X,\\ \\bar Y\\), \\[\\hat\\sigma^2=\\frac{(n_1-1)\\hat\\sigma_1^2+(n_2-1)\\hat\\sigma_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}.\\]\n\nExercise 2.9 Suppose that \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_{20}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_{20}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma^2)\\), and are mutually independent. Compute \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar X-\\bar Y\\right]\\).\n\n\nSolution 2.3. Using independence of \\(\\bar X\\) and \\(\\bar Y\\) and the result of the Exercise 2.6 , we have that \\[{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar X-\\bar Y\\right]={\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar X\\right]+{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar Y\\right]=\\sigma_1^2/n_1+\\sigma_1^2/n_2.\\]\n\nFirst, we write down the null and alternative hypothesis: \\[H_0\\colon \\Delta=0\\qquad vs.. \\qquad H_1\\colon \\Delta\\neq 0.\\] Here, we can do a two sample \\(t\\)-test.\nRecall that the pooled variance is given by: \\[\\hat\\sigma_p^2=\\frac{(n_1-1)\\hat\\sigma_1^2+(n_2-1)\\hat\\sigma_2}{(n_1+n_2-2)}\\] We previously said that a multiple of a one sample standard deviation follows a Chi-squared distribution. It follows that \\((n_1-1)\\hat\\sigma_1^2/\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi^2_{n_1-1}\\) and \\((n_2-1)\\hat\\sigma_2^2/\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi^2_{n_2-1}\\). Using the theory from here, specifically, \\((n_1-1)\\hat\\sigma_1^2/\\sigma^2+(n_2-1)\\hat\\sigma_2^2/\\sigma^2\\) is a sum of independent Chi-squared random variables, and so we have \\((n_1-1)\\hat\\sigma_1^2/\\sigma^2+(n_2-1)\\hat\\sigma_2^2/\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi^2_{n_1+n_2-2}\\).\nAgain, using the theory from here, under the null hypothesis, we have that \\[\\frac{\\bar X-\\bar Y}{\\hat\\sigma_p\\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}}=\\frac{(\\bar X-\\bar Y)/\\sigma\\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}}{\\hat\\sigma_p/\\sigma}\\sim t_{n_1+n_2-2}.\\]\nThis follows from 3 facts, first, letting \\(Z=(\\bar X-\\bar Y)/\\sqrt{{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar X-\\bar Y\\right]}\\), note that \\(Z\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). We have that \\[Z=(\\bar X-\\bar Y)/\\sqrt{{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\bar X-\\bar Y\\right]}=(\\bar X-\\bar Y)/\\sigma\\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}.\\]\nNext, we said earlier that \\(\\bar X\\) is independent of \\(\\hat\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\bar Y\\) is independent of \\(\\hat\\sigma_2\\). Now, recall that if two random variables are independent, then any function of them is also independent. In other words, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then for real functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we have that \\(g(X)\\) is independent of \\(f(Y)\\). It follows that \\(\\bar X\\) is independent of \\(\\hat\\sigma_2\\) and \\(\\bar Y\\) is independent of \\(\\hat\\sigma_1\\). It follows that \\(\\bar X-\\bar Y\\) is independent of \\(\\hat\\sigma_p\\). Then, \\[\\frac{(\\bar X-\\bar Y)/\\sigma\\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}}{\\hat\\sigma_p/\\sigma}\\] is a ratio of a standard normal random variable and the square root of a Chi-squared random variable, divided by its degrees of freedom. Further, the numerator and denominator are independent. Therefore, the above quantity follows a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n_1+n_2-2\\) degrees of freedom.\nThis means that if \\(\\left|\\frac{\\bar X-\\bar Y}{\\hat\\sigma_p\\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}}\\right|\\geq t_{n_1+n_2-2,1-\\alpha/2}\\), then we reject the null hypothesis.\nLet’s execute the test in R:\n\n# Normally, I will give you a dataset.

Let \\(I_n\\) be an \\((n \\times n)\\) identity matrix. Then \\[\nAI_n = A, \\ \\ \\ and \\ \\ \\ I_nB = B.\n\\]\n\nDefinition 2.11 Let \\(A\\) be an \\((n \\times n)\\) matrix. The inverse of \\(A\\), \\(A^{-1}\\), if exists satisfies \\[\nA A^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I_n\n\\] and if \\(A^{-1}\\) does not exist, then \\(A\\) is a singular matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFrom your linear algebra course, a prerequisite, you have learned the condition(s) for the existence of an inverse, The Invertible Matrix Theorem and you have learned how to obtain an inverse. You should review them.\nSpecifically, you should know how to obtain inverse of any diagonal matrix and any \\((2 \\times 2)\\) non-singular matrix, i.e., \\[\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{array} \\right)^{-1} =\n\\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{array} \\right).\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 2.5 Using our example matrices, let \\[\nW = UV = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 4 & -12 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\] Then \\[\nW^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1(-12) - 0(4)}\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -12 & 0 \\\\ -4 & 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1/3 & -1/12 \\end{array} \\right)\n.\\]\nYou can verify that \\(W W^{-1} = W^{-1} W = I_2\\).\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Important identities\nLastly, we introduce some important identities:\n\\[\nX = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & x_1 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{array} \\right), \\ \\ \\\nand \\ \\ \\\ny = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right)\n\\] Then \\[\nX^\\top X = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n & \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\\n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i & \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\end{array} \\right), \\ \\ \\ {\\textrm{and}} \\ \\ \\\nX^\\top y = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\n\\end{array} \\right).\n\\] Also \\(\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} 1^\\top y\\) and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = n \\bar{y}\\) \\ Finally \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - n \\bar{y}^2\\)\nThese are useful identities that we will use throughout this course.\nLastly, we recall an important application of matrices. An application of matrices: Suppose that we want to solve for \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) where they satisfy the following set of linearequations:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n2 x_1 + 3 x_2 - 4 x_3 & = & 0 \\\\\n-x_1 + 4 x_2 & = & -1 \\\\\n5 x_1 + x_2 - 2 x_3 & = & 4\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe can set it up in matrix form as follows: \\[\n\\left( \\begin{array}{rrr} 2 & 3 & -4 \\\\ -1 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 5 & 1 & -2 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4  \\end{array} \\right)\n\\] Or it can be presented as \\(A x = b\\). If \\(A\\) is not a singular matrix, then \\(x= A^{-1} b\\). Since \\(det(A) = 62\\), it is not a singular matrix. Solving the above equation this using \\(x= A^{-1} b\\) yields that \\(x = (1, 0, 0.5)^\\top\\).\nKeep this in mind, we will see it return in the next chapter.\n\n\n2.3.3 Homework stop 3\n\nExercise 2.11 Let \\[\nW =  \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 3 & 2 \\\\ -4 & 6 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\] and \\(x=(2,1)^\\top\\).

    "text": "2.4 Review Random Vectors\n\n2.4.1 Definition of random vectors\n\nDefinition 2.12 Let \\(Y_1, \\cdots, Y_n\\) be random variables. Then \\[\nY = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{array} \\right)\n\\] is an \\(n\\)-dimensional random vector.\n\nSimilar to a random variable, a random vector also comes with a probability mass function (if all the \\(Y_i\\) are discrete) or a probability density function (if all the \\(Y_i\\) are continuous), or a ``mixture’’ distribution (if some \\(Y_i\\) are discrete and others are continuous). In general, a random vector is drawn from a multivariate distribution, defined by the PMF or PDF. Just as before, the PMF and PDF range is non-negative, the PMF sums to 1 over all outcomes, and the PDF integrates to 1 over \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). One discrete multivariate distribution you have learned in 1131 is the Multinomial distribution. We will learn about the multivariate normal distribution soon.\n\n\n2.4.2 Expected Value and Covariance\n\nDefinition 2.13 Let \\(Y\\) be an \\(n\\)-dimensional random vector, then the mean (expected value) of \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[\n{\\textrm{E}}(Y) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} {\\textrm{E}}(Y_1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {\\textrm{E}}(Y_n) \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\mu\n\\] and the covariance of \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[\n{\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y\\right] = {\\textrm{E}}[ (Y - \\mu) (Y - \\mu)^\\top ] =\n(( {\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y_i, Y_j\\right] \\ )) = \\Sigma.\n\\]\n\nSometimes \\({\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y\\right]\\) is written as \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y\\right]\\).\nThe following are some facts about \\(\\Sigma\\):\n\\(\\Sigma\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix with the diagonal elements being the variances, \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y_i\\right]\\) for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\), and the off-diagonal elements being the covariances, \\({\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y_i, Y_j\\right]\\) for \\(i, j = 1, \\ldots, n\\) and \\(i \\ne j\\). \\(\\Sigma\\) is a symmetric, non-negative definite matrix. In this course, we further restrict it to be a positive definite matrix. \\(\\Sigma\\) is referred to as the covariance matrix.\n\n\n2.4.3 Properties of expected value and covariance\nLet \\(Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) be a random vector with \\(A\\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\) be matrices. It holds that\n\n\\({\\textrm{E}}(A + B Y) = A + B {\\textrm{E}}(Y)\\)\n\\({\\textrm{cov}}\\left[A + B Y\\right] = B {\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y\\right] B^\\top\\).\n\n\nExercise 2.12 Let \\(Y = (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)^\\top\\) be a random vector, where \\(Y_i\\) are i.i.d. random variables with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). What are the mean and covariance of \\(Y\\)? Use properties of random vectors to compute the mean and variance of the sample mean.\n\n\nSolution 2.4. First, \\({\\textrm{E}}(Y) = \\mu 1\\) and \\({\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y\\right] = \\sigma^2 I\\). Note that \\(\\bar{Y} = (Y_1 + \\cdots + Y_n)/n = \\frac{1}{n}1^\\top Y\\). Now, we have \\[\n{\\textrm{E}}(\\bar{Y}) = {\\textrm{E}}\\left( \\frac{1}{n}1^\\top Y \\right) =\n\\frac{1}{n} \\left( 1^\\top {\\textrm{E}}(Y) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} (n \\mu) = \\mu\n\\] and,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n{\\textrm{cov}}\\left[\\bar{Y}\\right] &={\\textrm{cov}}\\left[ \\frac{1}{n}1^\\top Y\\right]\\\\\n&=\n\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^2\n\\left( 1^\\top {\\textrm{cov}}\\left[Y\\right]  1 \\right) \\\\\n&=\n\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^2 (n \\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Multivariate normal distribution\nWe say that a random vector \\(X\\sim \\mathcal{N}_d(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) follows a multivariate normal distribution if \\(X\\) has PDF: \\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{d / 2}|\\Sigma|^{-1 / 2} \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu)^{\\prime} \\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mu)\\right\\}.\n\\]\nIf \\(X\\sim \\mathcal{N}_d(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) and \\(c\\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\), \\(A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}\\) then:\n\n\\(AX\\sim \\mathcal{N}(A\\mu,A\\Sigma A^\\top)\\).\n\\(c^\\top X\\sim \\mathcal{N}(c^\\top\\mu,c^\\top\\Sigma c)\\).\nAny conditional distribution for a subset of the variables conditional on another subset of variables is a multivariate distribution.\n\nUsing random vectors is a simple way of deriving lots of equations for this course. Working with vectors also allows those who are “geometrically gifted” to view the whole regression concepts geometrically!

What next? We might ask, what is this relationship precisely?\nIn particular, note that we have observed a sample of vectors \\((Y_1,X_1),\\ldots,(Y_1,X_n)\\). Now, we want to say something about the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in general. One way to do that is to suppose at the population level that \\[{\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]=f(X).\\] That is, on average, \\(Y\\) is equal to \\(f(X)\\). One way to do that is to assume that \\(Y|X=f(X)+\\epsilon,\\) where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random variable that satisfies \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\epsilon\\right]=0\\). This assumption means that, for each \\(Y_i\\), given \\(X_i\\), we have that \\(Y_i=f(X_i)+\\epsilon_i\\). Note that we do not observe \\(\\epsilon_i\\), but we can assume it exists. We can read this as \\(Y_i\\) is equal to \\(f(X_i)\\), plus some random, individual error \\(\\epsilon_i\\). The next step is to use the data to determine \\(f\\).\nUsing the data analysis steps from the Introduction we can write out the first few steps:\n\nQuestion about a population: ``How can we use weight to determine body fat percentage?’’\nData: \\((Y_1,X_1),\\ldots,(Y_{20},X_{20})\\), \\((Y_{i},X_{i})\\) are the body fat percentage and weight of individual \\(i\\in [20]\\).\n\nWe have explored the data with graphs and summary statistics. Now, we have posited the model \\(Y|X=f(X)+\\epsilon\\). Letting \\(f\\) be any function is too general. In fact, we can use the data to learn more about what \\(f\\) might be. Recall that earlier, we saw the scatter plot, where it looked like there was a linear relationship, (with some error), between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). (We can draw a straight line through the middle of the data.)\nLet’s make some assumptions that make the statistical analysis easier:\n\nAssume that \\(\\forall i\\in[20]\\), it holds that \\[Y_i|X_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_i+\\epsilon_i.\\] This means that we assume that \\(f\\) is a line.\nNext, we assume \\(\\forall i\\in[20]\\), \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\epsilon_i\\right]=0\\) and \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\epsilon_i\\right]=\\sigma^2\\). That is, the random error have the same mean and variance for each individual. In addition, the random errors average to 0.\nWe also assume that the individuals’ Body fat percentage, weights and random errors are independent, that is, \\(\\epsilon_i\\perp \\epsilon_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j,\\ i,j\\in [20]\\).\n\nThis is the simple linear regression model. That is, the simple linear regression model is the set of assumptions 1-3 given above.\nIt is often also assumed:\n\n\\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\),\n\nbut not always. Including the normality assumption is known as the simple normal linear regression model.\nIn general, a model is a set of assumptions about a population. The particular set of assumptions 1-3 is the simple linear regression model.\nThe following is some terminology used in regression analysis:\n\nHere, \\(Y_i\\) is the response variable, also known as the dependent variable, or the outcome variable.\nHere, \\(X_i\\) is the covariate, also known as the explanatory variable, or the independent variable.\n\nGiven a “question about a population” which involves regression, you should immediately identify the response variable and the covariates.\nNow, how can we interpret this model? That is, what does it mean to assume this model?\nFirst, observe that we assume that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]\\) is a line. This means there is a linear relationship between the average body fat percentage and weight.\nNext, observe that for any individual, their actual body fat percentage is given by \\(Y={\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]+\\epsilon_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_i+\\epsilon_i\\). Therefore, their body fat percentage will not fall exactly on the line \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_i\\). Rather, it will fall above or below the line, depending on \\(\\epsilon_i\\). Furthermore, if we assume that \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\), then we know from the properties of the Normal distribution that this random error will not exceed \\(2\\sigma\\) with high probability. Therefore, most of the time, an individual’s body fat percentage will fall within \\(2\\sigma\\) of the line.\nThird, notice that this quantity, \\(2\\sigma\\), does not depend on \\(X\\). That is, for any weight, we still expect an individual’s body fat percentage to be within \\(2\\sigma\\) of the line, regardless of the value of weight.\nFourth, if we knew \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1\\), then given someone’s weight, we could try to predict their body fat percentage given their weight. That is, we could calculate the expected body fat \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]\\). There would still be their individual random error \\(\\epsilon\\), so we would not be able to predict it exactly. However, if \\(\\sigma^2\\) isn’t too big, then we could produce an accurate prediction.\nTherefore, if the model assumptions are correct, we assume there exists some line, around which the body fat percentages are scattered uniformly.\nNext, we will simulate data from the normal simple linear regression model to gain a better understanding of this model. Suppose that \\(\\beta_0=-15\\), \\(\\beta_1=.2\\) and \\(\\sigma=5\\). Then we would observe the following.\n\n############################ Simulation\nset.seed(3252)\n\n# Suppose that beta_0=-15 and beta_1=0.2 and sigma=5, \n# then we would have that the mean function E(Y|X) is given by the following line:\ncurve(-15+.2*x,125,280,lwd=3,xlab=\"Weight\",ylab=\"Expected BF % (E(Y|X))\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Next, let's simulate some body weights from the uniform distribution\nWeight2=runif(20,135,250)\n\n# Then, we can simulate the population body fat percentages according to the model as follows:\n\n# Simulating 20 values of the random error, \nepsilons=rnorm(n=20,mean=0,sd=5)\n\n# Computing the simulated Body fat percentages: \nBfs=-15+.2*Weight2+epsilons\n\n# Plot the simulated values, and the mean function\ncurve(-15+.2*x,125,280,lwd=3,xlab=\"Weight\",ylab=\"BF %\")\npoints(Weight2,Bfs,pch=22,bg=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the data are scatted around the line uniformly? This is what data from a simple linear regression model looks like. Try changing the value in set.seed() and re-running the code. Notice how the data changes, but it is always scatted around the line uniformly? This is what we expect to see if the data follow a simple linear regression model.\nNotice how the data simulated from our model appears similar to the body fat percentage and weights data we observed? That means this model (set of assumptions) is a good fit for our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIn this model, and in regression in general, the response \\(Y\\) is not exactly equal to some function of \\(X\\) given by \\(f(X)\\). The model assumes that on average \\(Y=f(X)\\). Therefore, knowing someones “\\(X\\)” value will not exactly give us their \\(Y\\) value, but it would give us a good guess at it. The error \\(\\epsilon\\) is used to model the fact that someones “\\(X\\)” value will not exactly give us their \\(Y\\) value. Notice above how the actual points are scatted around the line, and not exactly equal to it! This is due to the errors \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 The multiple linear regression model\nBut what about matrices? Why did we study matrices then? We can write the regression model in terms of matrices and vectors, to make it more compact.\nNow, recall \\[Y_i|X_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_i+\\epsilon_i,\\] with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). It is more convenient mathematically to let \\(\\mathbf{Y}=(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n)^\\top\\), \\[\\mathbf{X}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n        1 & X_1\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots\\\\\n        1 & X_n\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}=\\left[ 1_n\\ |\\  (X_1,\\ldots,X_n)^\\top\\right],\\] \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0,\\beta_1)^\\top\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\epsilon}=(\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,\\epsilon_n)^\\top\\). Then we can write \\[\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}\\beta+\\mathbf{\\epsilon}.\\] Often, we overload the notation \\(Y\\), and use \\(Y\\) instead of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), and \\(X\\) instead of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\).\nThis form allows us to go beyond one explanatory variable very easily! Just add one column to \\(X\\) and one entry to \\(\\beta\\) for each new variable. Observe the following model: \\[Y_i|(X_{i1},\\ldots,X_{ik})=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_k X_{ik}+\\epsilon_i,\\] with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_i\\perp \\epsilon_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j,\\ i,j\\in [n]\\). This is known as the multiple linear regression model (MLR), or just the linear regression model for short. We can write this model in the same for as above: Let \\[\\mathbf{X}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n        1 & X_{11}&X_{1k}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots &\\vdots\\\\\n        1 & X_{n1}\\ldots &X_{nk}\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix},\\] and \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0,\\ldots,\\beta_k)^\\top\\). Then we can write the MLR as \\[\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}\\beta+\\mathbf{\\epsilon},\\] where \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[(\\right]\\epsilon)=0\\) and \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\epsilon\\right]=\\sigma^2 I\\). Notice how compact this is! As in the simple case, there is also the normal MLR, which further assumes that \\(\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2 I)\\).\nWe can then study the mathematical properties of \\[Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\] for general but fixed \\(k\\), under the normal or vanilla MLR, which will cover many models.\n\n\n3.1.3 Homework stop 1\n\nExercise 3.1 Try adjusting the parameters \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma\\) in the simulation, what happens to the data? What happens to the line?\n\n\nExercise 3.2 Is \\(\\beta\\) an estimate or a population parameter? Why?\n\n\nExercise 3.3 Come up with another possible form of \\(f\\) that is not linear.

That will allow us to estimated \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]\\) for any value of \\(X\\).\nRecall that we want to study the population model: \\[Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon.\\]\n\n3.2.1 Notation\nFor the model \\(Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\), we have\n\n\\(Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the response variable (a continuous random variable).\n\\(X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is the covariate matrix (Note that the first column is often \\(1_n\\)).\n\\(X_i\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) observed explanatory variable \\((i=1, \\ldots, n)\\) (not a random variable, in the sense that we condition on it).\n\\(\\beta\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is the coefficient vector .\n\\(\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the random error (continuous random variable) .\n\nWe may also refer to the actual observed values (versus the abstract mathematical concept of a random variable) as follows:\n\n\\(y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)^\\top\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the observed response variable (fixed/observed)\n\\(x_{ij}\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) observation of the \\(j^{th}\\) explanatory variable (fixed/observed) Data:\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nObserved data point\n\n\n\n\n1\n\\((y_1, x_{11}, x_{12}, \\ldots x_{1p})\\)\n\n\n2\n\\((y_2, x_{21}, x_{22}, \\ldots x_{2p})\\)\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nn\n\\((y_n, x_{n1}, x_{n2}, \\ldots x_{np})\\)\n\n\n\nWe posit that \\[Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon,\\]\nwhere we assume that\n\n\\(\\forall i\\in[n]\\), \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\epsilon_i\\right]=0\\).\n\\(\\forall i\\in[n]\\), \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\epsilon_i\\right]=\\sigma^2\\) (constant variance and is also known as homogeneity.)\nWe also would assume that \\(\\epsilon_i\\perp \\epsilon_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j,\\ i,j\\in [n]\\).\n\\(\\beta\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is the unknown, population coefficient vector.\n\\(X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is a covariate matrix.\n\nLet’s talk about \\(\\beta\\). How do we interpret \\(\\beta\\)? Suppose we know \\(\\beta\\). Then:\nNote that \\[{\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i|X_{i}\\right]={\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\beta^\\top X_i+\\epsilon\\right]=\\beta^\\top X_i=\\beta_1X_{1,1}+\\ldots+\\beta_pX_{i,p}\\]\nWhat does each \\(\\beta_j\\) mean? Suppose that \\(X_j\\) is a continuous covariate.\nWe can interpret (\\(\\beta_j\\)) as follows:\nHolding \\(X_{i,1},\\ldots,X_{i,j-1},X_{i,j+1},\\ldots, X_{i,p}\\) constant, a one unit increase in \\(X_{i,j}\\) causes, on average, a \\(\\beta_j\\) unit increase in \\(Y_i\\).\nFrom another angle, we have that \\(\\partial {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y\\right]/\\partial X=\\beta\\), therefore, the rate of change with respect to the \\(j^{th}\\) covariate is \\(\\beta_j\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe “on average” and “holding other covariates constant” are very important components of the interpretation. First, the on average acknowledges the random error \\(\\epsilon\\). In other words, a one unit increase in \\(X_{i,j}\\) will not certainly increase \\(Y_i\\), but it will on average. Next, the “holding other covariates constant” is used to mention how correlations between covariates are handled by the model. Some of the covariates in the model may be correlated, so increases in a given covariate may often be associated with changes in another covariate. This is not accounted for in the coefficient vectors \\(\\beta\\). That is why we must specify “holding other covariates constant”.\nFor instance, if a model includes a terms for years of education attained and income, we know that as the number of years of education increase we expect to see a rise in income levels. As a result, to interpret the effect of coefficient on income, we must “hold years of education constant”, comparing what is expected with income changes but education does not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nFor now, we can assume that all of the covariates \\(X_j\\) are continuous variables. Later in the course, there may be categorical covariates. In this case, the \\(\\beta_j\\) corresponding to the categorical covariates have a different interpretation. We will return to this later.\n\n\nRecall Example 3.1. We assume \\(\\forall i\\in[20]\\), it holds that \\[Y_i|X_i=\\beta^\\top X_i+\\epsilon_i,\\] with \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\epsilon_i\\perp \\epsilon_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j,\\ i,j\\in [20]\\). A one unit increase in weight causes, on average, a \\(\\beta_2\\) unit increase in body fat percentage. Since \\(\\beta_1\\) is the intercept, it has a special interpretation. \\(\\beta_1\\) is the average value of \\(Y_i\\) given \\(X_i=0\\). It is also helpful to note that \\({\\textrm{cov}}(Y)=\\sigma^2 I\\).\n\n\n3.2.2 Least squares estimation\nOkay, but we don’t know \\(\\beta\\)! Just like we estimate the population mean with the sample mean, we need to estimate \\(\\beta\\). We would like an estimate \\(\\hat\\beta\\), so that we can predict body fat percentage from weight. What is our best guess at \\(\\beta\\), given the data? One way to answer this, is through the method of least squares.\nReturning to our example, recall that:\n\nplot(df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose we want to determine if \\(\\beta\\) is more likely to be \\((-35,0.3)^\\top\\) or \\((-22,0.2)^\\top\\) . How can we say which line is a better to our data? One way is to graph them on top of the data and determine which one looks better. Let’s plot these lines.\n\nplot(df)\n# plot Y=-35+0.3X\nabline(-35,0.3,lwd=2)\n# plot Y=-25+0.2X\nabline(-22,0.2,col='red',lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts not clear which one fits the data better. Even if it was clear, obviously, we cannot plot all possible lines. So how can we determine which line fits the data the “best”?\nTo do this, we have to define what “best” means quantitatively. For instance, one might ask which line minimizes the sum of the squared distances of the observed data points to the line? This line is then said to be the “best” line. Mathematically, given a proposed value of \\(\\beta\\), say \\(\\beta_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), the signed distance to the hyperplane \\(X\\beta_0\\) is \\(\\epsilon_0=Y-X\\beta_0\\). The squared distances to the hyperplane \\(X\\beta_0\\) is then \\(\\epsilon_0^\\top\\epsilon_0 =(Y-X\\beta_0)^\\top (Y-X\\beta_0)\\). We can then formulate this as a math problem: Which \\(\\beta_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) minimizes \\(\\epsilon_0^\\top\\epsilon_0\\)? i.e., \\(\\hat\\beta =\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{\\beta_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^p}\\epsilon_0^\\top\\epsilon_0.\\) It is more convenient to just write \\[\\hat\\beta =\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^p}(Y-X\\beta)^\\top (Y-X\\beta).\\]\nIn this framework, the “best” estimate is given by \\[\\hat\\beta =\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^p}(Y-X\\beta)^\\top (Y-X\\beta).\\] Note best is in the sense of minimizing the average squared distance to the hyperplane/line. We could also define best in terms of some other metric, such as average absolute distance to the hyperplane/line. For now, we will stick with this metric.\nThe next step is to solve: \\[\\hat\\beta =\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^p}(Y-X\\beta)^\\top (Y-X\\beta).\\]\nHow do we minimize a function???\nRECALL in calculus, to find the minimum of a function we:\n\nObtain the first two derivatives of the function.\nSet the first derivative to zero and solve for the critical value.\nUse the second derivative to verify the critical value minimized the function.\n\nGoal: Compute \\(\\hat\\beta\\) – Minimize \\(g(\\beta)=(Y-X\\beta)^\\top (Y-X\\beta)\\). (It may be useful to review taking derivatives with respect to vectors here.\nStep 1a: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}&= &\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}(Y-X\\beta)^\\top (Y-X\\beta)\\\\\n&= &\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}\\left[Y^\\top Y-2(X\\beta)^\\top Y+(X\\beta)^\\top X\\beta\\right] \\tag{Transpose and distribute}\\\\\n&= &-2\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}\\beta^\\top X^\\top Y+\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}\\beta^\\top X^\\top X\\beta \\tag{$(AB)^\\top=B^\\top A^\\top$}\\\\\n&= &-2 X^\\top Y+2X^\\top X\\beta \\tag{$\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}x^\\top Ax=2 A$ if $A$ symmetric, $\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}x^\\top a=a$ }\\\\\n&= &-2X^\\top (Y-X\\beta ).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nStep 1b: (Do this for homework) \\[\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial\\beta\\partial\\beta^\\top}=2X^\\top X.\\]\nStep 2: We now need \\(X^\\top X\\) to be invertible, so we will assume that \\(X\\) is full rank and \\(n\\geq p\\). \\[\\begin{align*}\n    -2X^\\top (Y-X\\beta )=0\\\\\n    &\\implies X^\\top Y=X^\\top X\\beta\\\\\n    &\\implies \\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top Y.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nStep 3:\nRecall that if the Hessian matrix is positive definite at a critical point, then that critical point is a local minimum. Since we have assumed \\(X\\) is full rank, this implies that \\(X^\\top X\\) is positive definite.\nTo summarize, the steps have proceeded as follows:\n\nStep 1a: \\(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\beta}=-2X^\\top (Y-X\\beta )\\)\nStep 1b: \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial\\beta\\partial\\beta^\\top}=2X^\\top X\\) (Do this for homework)\nStep 2: \\(-2X^\\top (Y-X\\beta )=0\\implies X^\\top Y=X^\\top X\\beta\\) \\(\\implies \\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top Y\\)\nStep 3: \\(2X^\\top X\\) is positive definite, and so \\[\\hat\\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top Y.\\]\n\nThe estimate \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is known as the least squares estimate of the regression coefficients.\n\nDefinition 3.1 The least squares estimate of the regression coefficients is \\[\\hat\\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top Y.\\]\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Example\n\nExample 3.2 In the body weight example Example 3.1, write down \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) and compute \\(\\hat\\beta\\). Interpret \\(\\hat\\beta\\).\n\nFirst, we have that \\[Y=\\left( 6   , 21  , 15  , 6   , 22  , 31  , 32  , 21  , 25  , 30  , 10  , 20  , 22  , 9   , 38  , 10  , 27  , 12  , 10  , 28  \\right)^\\top\\] \\[X=\\left[1_{20}\\ | \\left( 175 , 181 , 200 , 159 , 196 , 192 , 205 , 173 , 187 , 188 ,\n188 , 240 , 175 , 168 , 246 , 160 , 215 , 159 , 146 , 219  \\right)^\\top\\right]\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor matrices \\(A,B\\) which have the same number of rows, \\(C=[A | B]\\) is horizontal concatenation of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). This notation indicates that the matrix \\(C\\) is formed by placing \\(A\\) an \\(B\\) side by side, joining them horizontally. Therefore, \\(X\\) is the matrix whose first column is made up of ones, and second column is made up of the body weights.\n\n\nLet’s use R to compute \\(\\hat\\beta\\).\n\n#Define X and Y\nX=cbind(rep(1,nrow(df)), df$Weight)\nY=df$BodyFat\n\n# cast to column vec\nY=matrix(Y,ncol=1)\n\n#X'X \nX_p_X=t(X)%*%X\n\n#X'X inverse\nX_p_X_inverse=solve(X_p_X)\n\n\n#LS\nbeta_hat= X_p_X_inverse%*%t(X)%*%Y\nbeta_hat\n\n            [,1]\n[1,] -27.3762623\n[2,]   0.2498741\n\n# We can also use Rs lm() function to do this: \n# This code is essential for the course. \n# The first argument is the formula \nmodel=lm(BodyFat ~ Weight, data=df)\n\n#The summary function prints the model output. \n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = BodyFat ~ Weight, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-12.5935  -5.7904   0.6536   5.2731  10.4004 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

The basic usage involves specifying a formula and a data frame. The syntax is given by lm(formula, data, ...).\nThe data argument should be the dataframe which contains your data. The formula argument is used to specify the model to be fitted. It provides a symbolic description of the model, indicating the response variable and the predictors/covariates, as well as the relationships between them. The left-hand side should be the name of your response variable, as it is named in your dataframe. To see the names of your variables use the names() function, e.g., names(df). The right-hand side contains the covariates you want to include in your model. For instance, above, the formula is given by BodyFat ~ Weight . Note that BodyFat is the response and Weight is the covariate.\nWe now list some important properties of the least squares estimator.\n\nExercise 3.5 Compute \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\hat\\beta\\right]\\) and \\({\\textrm{cov}}(\\hat\\beta)\\).\n\n\nSolution 3.1. It holds that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\hat\\beta\\right]=\\beta\\) and \\({\\textrm{cov}}(\\hat\\beta)=\\sigma^2 I\\).\n\nRecall that an estimator is unbiased if its expectation equals the population parameter it is trying to estimate. After completing Exercise 3.5 you will see that \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is unbiased for the parameter \\(\\beta\\).\nThe least squares estimator is also the “best linear unbiased estimator”, or the BLUE. This is known as the Gauss–Markov theorem. This means that under the assumptions of the linear regression model, over any unbiased estimator of \\(\\beta\\) we can construct, which is a linear combination of \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n\\), the estimator \\(\\hat\\beta\\) has the smallest variance (and therefore, the smallest mean squared error. Recall that for an estimator \\(\\hat\\alpha\\), the mean squared error is given by \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[||\\beta-\\hat\\alpha||^2\\right]\\).)\nThe Gauss–Markov theorem does not require the random error to be normally distributed. If we are willing to assume that \\(\\epsilon\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2 I)\\), then \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is also the maximum likelihood estimator and the “uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator”, or UMVUE. This means that \\(\\hat\\beta\\) has lower variance than any other unbiased estimator, no matter what the true value of \\(\\beta\\) is.\nOne might ask, how can we use \\(\\hat\\beta\\) to predict body fat percentage given weight? The estimate \\(\\hat\\beta\\) gives us a best guess at the coefficients. Therefore, our best guess at someones body fat is given by \\[Best\\ Guess=-27.3762623+ 0.2498741 \\times Weight.\\] For instance, for someone who is 170 pounds, we would guess that their body fat percentage is \\(-27.3762623+ 0.2498741 \\times 170=\\) 15.1023347.\n\n\n3.2.4 Homework stop 2\n\nExercise 3.6 Why do we need \\(\\hat\\beta\\), why not use \\(\\beta\\)?.\n\n\nExercise 3.7 Is \\(\\hat\\beta\\) an estimate or a population parameter?

    "text": "3.3 Least squares inference\nRecall we estimate the parameter \\(\\beta\\) using least squares:\nRecall that \\(\\hat\\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top Y\\). We can predict a new weight \\(Y_{new}|X=x\\) with \\(\\hat y_{new}=x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\). We may be interested in the following questions: How good is \\(\\hat y_{new}\\) as a prediction, on average? How will new observations vary about the line? For example, given a specific weight, how will does body fat percentage vary around the regression line? How does \\(\\hat\\beta\\) vary around \\(\\beta\\)? Is there strong evidence that \\(Y\\) has a relationship with \\(X\\)? Is \\(X\\) adding information about \\(Y\\) at all?\nTo answer these questions, we need to look at the variation of our estimates and our data.\n\n3.3.1 Important quantities: Residuals and fitted values\nWe now introduce some very important quantities: We call the estimated values given our observed \\(X\\) the fitted values: \\(\\hat Y=X\\hat\\beta\\). The fitted values are what our model would estimate the vector \\(Y\\) to be. We call \\(\\hat \\epsilon=Y-\\hat Y\\) is the residual vector. The \\(i\\)th entry of \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\), say \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\), is the \\(i\\)th residual.

This decomposition is crucial for evaluating the performance of the regression model and understanding the contributions of various factors.\nThe residuals describe one type of variation of the response values. We can also consider the total variation of the response. The total variation of the response, or the sum of squares total/total sum of squares (\\(SST\\)) is given by \\(SST=(n-1)\\hat\\sigma_y=\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\\bar Y)^2=(Y-\\bar Y 1)^\\top (Y-\\bar Y 1)\\). It can be shown that the \\(SST\\) can be decomposed as follows: \\[SST=(Y-\\bar Y 1)^\\top (Y-\\bar Y 1)=(Y-\\hat Y)^\\top (Y-\\hat Y)+(\\hat Y-\\bar Y)^\\top (\\hat Y-\\bar Y)=\\hat\\epsilon^\\top \\hat\\epsilon+(\\hat Y-\\bar Y)^\\top (\\hat Y-\\bar Y).\\] That is, \\(SST=SSE+SSModel\\) where\n\n\\(SSModel\\), OR \\(SSM\\) measures the total variations of the response explained by the covariates \\(X\\) via the model based on \\(\\hat\\beta\\).\n\\(SSE\\) measures the total variations of the response unexplained by the covariates \\(X\\) via the model based on \\(\\hat\\beta\\).\nNote there are sometimes other names for \\(SSE\\) and \\(SSModel\\), such as \\(SSRegression\\), \\(SSwithin\\) and \\(SSbetween\\), etc.\n\nSo, we have that the total variation in the response can be broken down into that which is explained by the \\(X\\) values, and that which is unexplained.\nAn interesting observation is given as follows: The first column of the \\(X\\) matrix is given by \\(1_n\\), which implies that \\[\\bar Y 1=X\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\bar Y\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\] This means that if we let \\(\\hat\\beta_*=(\\bar Y,0,\\ldots,0)^\\top\\), then \\((Y-\\bar Y 1)\\) would be the signed distances to (or the residuals of) the regression hyperplane corresponding to \\(\\hat\\beta_*\\). Since \\(\\hat\\beta\\) minimizes the sum of squared residuals, we must have that the hyperplane corresponding to \\(\\hat\\beta\\) has a smaller sum of squared residuals than the regression hyperplane corresponding to \\(\\hat\\beta_*\\). Therefore, we must have that \\(\\hat \\epsilon^\\top \\hat \\epsilon\\leq (Y-\\bar Y 1)^\\top (Y-\\bar Y 1)\\).\nEach of these terms in the decomposition is associated with a certain number of degrees of freedom.\n\nTotal: \\(dfT=n-1\\).\nModel: \\(dfM=\\#\\ \\textbf{non-zero }\\beta-1\\).\nError: \\(dfE=n-\\#\\ \\textbf{non-zero }\\beta\\).\n\nIntuitively, since the \\(SSE\\) is the variance unexplained by the model/covariates, the \\(SSE\\) is related to the error variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). In fact, to estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\), we use \\[\\hat\\sigma^2=MSE=\\frac{SSE}{dfE}.\\]\nThe null model is defined as \\(Y|X=\\beta_0+\\epsilon\\). This is the model where the last \\(p-1\\) terms in the true vector \\(\\beta\\) are \\(0\\). This model says that \\(Y\\) does not depend on \\(X\\). In the null model, we only need to estimate the mean, so \\(df=n-1\\). Therefore, under the null model, \\[\\begin{align*}\n        \\hat\\sigma^2=(n-1)^{-1}SST&=\\hat\\sigma_Y^2\\\\\n        &=(n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\\bar Y)^2=(n-1)^{-1}(Y-\\bar Y 1)^\\top (Y-\\bar Y 1).\n    \\end{align*}\\] Therefore, in the null model, the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) via the \\(MSE\\) is just the usual estimate of the variance of the response. This is intuitive!\nThe following table can be used to summarize the variation in the response:\n\n\n\nSource\nSS\ndf\nMS\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\\(SSM\\)\n\\(dfM\\)\n\\(MSModel = SSM/dfM\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(SSE\\)\n\\(dfE\\)\n\\(MSE = SSE/dfE\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(SST\\)\n\\(dfT\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is very important to be able to interpret these terms! The derivation is also important. However, we can use a machine to compute anything for us, so memorizing the formula is not helpful.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Coefficients of determination\nA model is a good model if it can explain a fair amount of the variation in the response. (You can think that the model explains “changes” in the response.) In other words, \\(SSModel\\) should be as close to \\(SSTotal\\) as possible; or equivalently, \\(SSError\\) should be as close to 0 as possible. Now, “close” is a relative term, and so we need another value to reference to. This is where the \\(R^2\\) comes in: \\[R^2=\\frac{SSModel}{SST},\\] and is the proportion of variation explained by the model. It is clear that \\(0 \\leq  R^2 \\leq 1\\), and so rescaling the data will not affect \\(R^2\\) (like it would affect the sum of squares terms \\(SST,SSE,SSM\\)). If \\(R^2\\) is close to 1, it is large – “close to 1” is a subjective/area dependent. Generally, the larger the \\(R^2\\), the better the model!\nTo compare different models, we could potentially add different covariates and see if \\(R^2\\) improves. However, every time you add any variable, \\(R^2\\) will always increase. Therefore, it is common to use the adjusted coefficient of determination: \\[\\bar R^2=1-(1-R^2)\\frac{n-1}{n-p}.\\] Thus, the (adjusted) coefficient of determination can be used as a measure of how well the regression model fits the data (how much variance is explained). It could also be used to compare models.\n\n\n3.3.4 The \\(F\\) test\nThe coefficients of determination are summary statistics which give an idea of the fit of the model. We would also like a significance test that tells us whether the covariates explain \\(Y\\), or what we observed was simply due to sampling variation.\nIf \\(\\beta=(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p)^\\top\\) then let \\(\\tilde\\beta=(\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\beta_p)^\\top\\). That is \\(\\tilde\\beta\\) is the regression coefficients without the intercept term. Similarly, let \\(\\tilde{\\hat\\beta}=(\\hat\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\hat\\beta_p)^\\top\\). Now, we want to avoid the situation where \\(\\tilde\\beta=0\\) but \\(\\tilde{\\hat\\beta}\\neq 0\\) due to sampling variation.\nTo do this, we perform a significance test: \\[H_0:\\tilde\\beta=0\\qquad vs\\qquad H_1:\\tilde\\beta\\neq 0.\\]\nFirst, we need the normality assumption to perform significance test: Assume \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). With this assumption, the model is then known as the Normal Multiple Linear Regression Model. It is important to note that the least squares method does not require this assumption, and this assumption is required only for the significance test to be valid. To test the hypothesis stated above, we use the overall \\(F\\) test and the observed test statistic is \\(F_{obs} = MSModel/MSE.\\) Why?\nWith the extra normality assumption, we have the following holds:\n\n\\(Y|X\\) is normally distributed.\nWe have that \\(SSM/\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi^2_{dfM}\\) and \\(SSE/\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi^2_{dfE}\\).\nFurthermore, \\(SSM\\perp SSE\\).\n\nRecall that the ratio of two independent \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions divided by their respective degrees of freedom follows an \\(F\\) distribution. Therefore, we have that \\(F_{obs}\\sim F_{dfM,dfE}\\). The corresponding p-value is \\(\\Pr(W &gt; F_{obs})\\) where \\(W\\sim F_{dfM;dfE}\\). We can alternatively reject the null hypothesis if \\(F_{obs}&gt;F_{dfM;dfE,1-alpha}\\), where \\(F_{obs}&gt;F_{dfM;dfE,1-alpha}\\) is the \\(1-\\alpha\\) quantile of the \\(F_{dfM,dfE}\\) distribution.\nWe can now present the complete ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nSS\ndf\nMS\nF\np-value\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\\(SSM\\)\n\\(dfM\\)\n\\(MSModel = \\frac{SSR}{dfM}\\)\n\\(F = \\frac{MSModel}{MSE}\\)\n\\(\\Pr(W &gt; F_{obs})\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(SSE\\)\n\\(dfE\\)\n\\(MSE = \\frac{SSE}{dfE}\\)\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(SST\\)\n\\(dfT\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.4 In Example 3.1, compute and interpret the coefficients of determination.

Moreover, we use \\(MSE\\) to estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\). Next, we learned that we can summarize the \\(SS,\\ df\\), and \\(MS\\) in an ANOVA table. We used the \\(F\\) test and the coefficient of determination to evaluate the quality of the model, i.e., to see the amount of information \\(X\\) provides about \\(Y\\).\nWhen the model is a significant model, then, at least one of the individual explanatory variables is useful in explaining the response. We may be interested in whether a specific covariate, or set of covariates is useful in explaining the response variable. We now learn how we can test for the significance of each individual explanatory variable separately and how we can test for the significance of a subset of explanatory variables. Note that these tests also require that the random error is normally distributed.\nTo test for significance and compute confidence intervals of a single variate, we have to compute the distribution of \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\). We first compute the mean and variance of \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\). First, given that \\({\\textrm{E}}(\\hat\\beta) = \\beta\\), we have \\({\\textrm{E}}(\\hat\\beta_j) = \\beta_j\\). Next, \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_j\\right]\\) is the \\((j, j)^{th}\\) entry of \\({\\textrm{cov}}(\\hat\\beta)\\). In addition, we have derived that \\({\\textrm{cov}}(\\hat\\beta) = (X^\\top X)^{-1} \\sigma^2\\).\nNow, recall that if \\(Z\\) is multivariate normal, i.e., \\(Z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\), then \\(b+AZ\\sim\\mathcal{N}(b+A\\mu,A\\Sigma A^\\top)\\), i.e., \\(b+AZ\\) is also multivariate normal. Therefore, since we have assumed that \\(\\epsilon\\sim \\mathcal{N}_n(0,\\sigma^2 I)\\) and that \\(Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\), it follows that \\(Y|X\\sim \\mathcal{N}_n(X\\beta,\\sigma^2 I)\\). Next, we may recall that \\(\\hat\\beta=(X^\\top X)^{-1} XY\\). Let \\(A=(X^\\top X)^{-1} X\\). Then \\(\\hat\\beta=AY\\). It follows that \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is also multivariate normal! Putting everything together, we have that \\(\\hat\\beta\\sim \\mathcal{N}_p(\\beta,(X^\\top X)^{-1} \\sigma^2)\\).\n\nTheorem 3.1 Under the assumptions of the normal linear regression model it holds that \\(\\hat\\beta\\sim \\mathcal{N}_p(\\beta,(X^\\top X)^{-1} \\sigma^2)\\).\n\nNow that we have the distribution of \\(\\hat\\beta\\), we can use it to compute the confidence intervals for \\(\\beta_j\\)s.\nRecall from introductory statistics (MATH 1131) that you learned that if we want to compute a confidence interval for the sample mean and the sample variance was unknown, we had to estimate the variance. Similarly, here, the variance of \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\) contains \\(\\sigma\\), an unknown parameter. Recall that, we estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\) by \\(MSE\\), and so we can estimate the variance of \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\) by \\(\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_j\\right] = (X^\\top X)_{j,j}^{-1} MSE\\).\nIt can be shown that \\(\\hat\\beta\\perp MSE\\). Therefore, we have that \\[\\frac{\\hat\\beta_j - \\beta_j}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_j)}}\\sim t_{dfE}.\\]\nNow that we know the distribution of \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\), we can perform significance testing and compute confidence intervals.\nIf we want to test \\[H_0\\colon \\beta_j=\\beta_j^0\\qquad vs \\qquad \\beta_j\\neq\\beta_j^0\\] we can do the following.\nThe observed test statistic is \\(TS=\\frac{\\hat\\beta_j - \\beta_j^0}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_j)}}\\). Note that, under the null hypothesis, we have that \\(\\frac{\\hat\\beta_j - \\beta_j^0}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_j)}}\\sim t_{dfE}\\). Thus, the corresponding \\(p\\)-value is obtained based on the \\(t_{dfE}\\) distribution. Specifically, we can compute the p-value \\(\\Pr\\left(-|TS|&lt;Z\\right)+\\Pr\\left(|TS|&gt;Z\\right)=2*\\Pr\\left(|TS|&gt;Z\\right)\\), where \\(Z\\sim t_{dfE}\\).\nThe test proceeds as follows:\n\nState the hypotheses \\[H_0\\colon \\beta_j=\\beta_j^0\\qquad vs \\qquad H_1:\\ \\beta_j\\neq\\beta_j^0.\\]\nCompute the test statistic \\(\\frac{\\hat\\beta_j - \\beta_j^0}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_j)}}\\) and the p-value.\nInterpret the p-value, and use it to decide whether you reject the null hypothesis.\n\nOften, one may choose a threshold \\(\\alpha\\), and reject the null hypothesis if the p-value falls below that threshold. Other times, we use the p-value as a description of evidence against the null. If it is larger than 0.05, but still small, then that still constitutes some evidence against the null hypothesis.\nLet’s now discuss one-sided hypotheses. First, consider: \\[H_0\\colon \\beta_j\\leq  \\beta_j^0\\qquad vs \\qquad H_1:\\ \\beta_j&gt; \\beta_j^0\\] Then, if the alternative hypothesis is true, we expect \\(TS\\) to be positive. The p-value is given by \\(\\Pr\\left(TS&gt;Z\\right)\\), where \\(Z\\sim t_{dfE}\\). Notice that the p-value is measuring how extremely positive \\(TS\\) is. Using the threshold method, we can also check if \\(TS&gt; t_{dfE,1-\\alpha}\\). Next, if we want to test \\[H_0\\colon \\beta_j\\geq  \\beta_j^0\\qquad vs \\qquad H_1:\\ \\beta_j&lt; \\beta_j^0,\\] then if the alternative hypothesis is true, we expect \\(TS\\) to be negative. The p-value is given by \\(\\Pr\\left(TS&lt;Z\\right)\\), where \\(Z\\sim t_{dfE}\\). Notice that the p-value is measuring how extremely negative \\(TS\\) is. Using the threshold method, we can also check if \\(TS&lt; t_{dfE,\\alpha}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe use \\(t_{k, p}\\) to denote the \\(p\\)th quantile of the \\(t\\) distribution with \\(k\\) degrees of freedom. For \\(p=0.025\\) and large \\(k\\), this is approximately equal to 2.\n\n\n\nIn Example 3.1, test if the coefficient for weight is not equal to 1. Next, test if the coefficient for weight is greater than 1. Lastly, test if the coefficient for weight is not equal to 0.\n\nFirst, we have that \\[H_0\\colon \\beta_1= 15\\qquad vs \\qquad H_1:\\ \\beta_1\\neq 15.\\] Now, let’s execute the test:\n\n#changing matrix to scalar\nMSE=c(MSE)\nhvar_beta=solve(t(X)%*%X)*MSE\n\n\nTS=beta_hat[2]/sqrt(hvar_beta[2,2])\n\n# not equal\n# pt(x,df) is the CDF of a t distributed RV with df degrees of freedom at x. \np_val=2*(1-pt(abs(TS),dfe))\np_val\n\n[1] 0.0006434484\n\n# We can also use the model object to test if it is not equal to 0: \n# The test statistic and the pvalue are given in the t value and Pr(&gt;|t|)  columns, respectively. \nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = BodyFat ~ Weight, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-12.5935  -5.7904   0.6536   5.2731  10.4004 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We can conclude that with 95% (99%) confidence, the true coefficient for weight likely falls within (0.12, 0.38) ((0.08,0.42)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe key to understanding a confidence interval is to realize that the end points of the interval depend on the sample, and are therefore, random. On the other hand, the population parameter is not random, it is fixed. Therefore, if we drew a different sample, the interval would move, and there is a \\((1-100\\alpha )\\)% chance that that interval catches the population parameter. Most of the time it will contain the parameter, but not always.\n\n\nRecall that the point of computing a confidence interval is to report the uncertainty in our estimate that resulted from drawing a sample. We expect the true parameter to be somewhere in that range, and our best guess at the parameter is given by the center of the interval.\n\n\n3.3.7 Inference for the mean response and prediction intervals\nWe may wish to estimate the average response at a specific set of the covariates \\(x\\). Given \\(x\\), the theoretical mean response is \\(x^\\top \\beta\\). Given \\(x\\), we can estimate the mean response as \\(x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\). For instance, what is the average body fat percentage at 160 pounds? How accurate is our estimate? We can use a confidence interval to answer this question.\nNote that the expectation and variance of the estimate of the mean response are given by \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]=x^\\top \\beta\\) and \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]=x^\\top(X^\\top X)^{-1}x\\sigma^2\\). Again, we must estimate \\(\\sigma\\) and we can write \\(\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]=x^\\top(X^\\top X)^{-1}x MSE\\).\n\nExercise 3.13 Under the assumptions of the normal linear regression model, show that for a fixed covariate vector \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), \\(x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\) has a multivariate normal distribution and find it’s mean and variance. Argue that \\(\\frac{x^\\top\\hat\\beta - x^\\top \\beta}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]}}\\sim t_{dfE}\\).\n\nIt can be shown that a (\\(1-\\alpha)100\\)% confidence interval for the mean response \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X=x\\right]\\) is \\[x^\\top\\hat\\beta\\pm t_{dfE,\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]}.\\]\nSimilarly, if we want to test \\[H_0\\colon {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X=x\\right]=\\mu_0\\qquad vs \\qquad {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X=x\\right]\\neq \\mu_0\\] we can do the following:\nThe observed test statistic is \\(TS(x,\\mu_0)=\\frac{x^\\top\\hat\\beta - \\mu_0}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[x^\\top \\hat\\beta\\right]}}\\). Observe that under the null hypothesis, we have that \\(TS(x,\\mu_0)\\sim t_{dfE}\\). Therefore, the p-value is given by \\(2*\\Pr\\left(|TS(x,\\mu_0)|&gt;Z\\right)\\).\nSimilar to the previous section, we can also perform one-sided tests:\n\nRight-sided test \\((H_1\\colon x^\\top \\beta&gt;\\mu_0\\ )\\): p-value \\(\\Pr\\left(TS(x,\\mu_0)&gt;Z\\right)\\).\nLeft-sided test \\((H_1\\colon x^\\top \\beta&lt;\\mu_0\\ )\\): p-value \\(\\Pr\\left(TS(x,\\mu_0)&lt;Z\\right)\\).\n\nWe may also wish to predict what the response will be, given a new set of covariates. On top of that, we may again wish to quantify how much error there is in our prediction. For instance, what is the predicted body fat percentage of someone who is 160 pounds? Note that this differs from the previous section. In the previous section, we were interested in the average body fat percentage of someone who is 160 pounds. Here, we are interested in predicting the body fat percentage of a single, specific person, and not the average of the whole population.\nSpecifically, suppose that we have a subject whose covariates are given by \\(z\\), but we do not know the value of the subjects response, which we can denote by \\(Y_{new}\\). Then the true response is \\((Y_{new}|Z=z)\\ =z^\\top\\beta+\\epsilon_{new}\\).\nSuppose we want to predict \\(Y_{new}\\) and give an idea of how much error is in our prediction. The predicted response is known, and is given by \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_{new}|Z=z\\right]=z^\\top\\hat\\beta\\). We have \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y_{new}|Z=z\\right]={\\textrm{Var}}\\left[z\\hat\\beta\\right]+{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\epsilon_{new}\\right]=z^\\top(X^\\top X)^{-1}z\\sigma^2+\\sigma^2\\). Therefore, the variation in a new response is the variation in our estimate of \\(\\beta\\) plus the inherent population variation, \\(\\sigma^2\\). We have that this can be estimated with: \\(\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y_{new}|Z=z\\right]=z^\\top(X^\\top X)^{-1}zMSE+MSE\\).\n\nExercise 3.14 Under the assumptions of the normal linear regression model, show that for a fixed covariate vector \\(z\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), \\(Y_{new}|Z=z\\) has a multivariate normal distribution and find it’s mean and variance. Argue that given \\(Z=z\\), \\[\\frac{Y_{new}-z^\\top\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y_{new}\\right]}} \\sim t_{dfE}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the (\\(1-\\alpha)100\\)% prediction interval for \\(Y_{new}\\) is given by: \\[z\\hat\\beta\\pm t_{dfE,\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{z^\\top(X^\\top X)^{-1}zMSE+MSE}.\\]\nNote that the prediction interval is wider than that of the mean response interval for the same covariate vector \\(z\\). That is because it is more difficult to predict the response for a specific person than it is to estimate a mean of a population. Furthermore, the interpretation of a prediction interval is different. A (\\(1-\\alpha)100\\)% prediction interval can be interpreted it as follows. Given a (\\(1-\\alpha)100\\)% prediction interval for \\(Y_{new}|Z=z\\), say \\((a,b)\\), we say that the probability \\(Y_{new}\\) is in \\((a,b)\\) is (\\(1-\\alpha)100\\)%. Note that this differs substantially from a confidence interval!\n\nExample 3.5 In Example 3.1, execute the following: What is a 95% confidence interval for the mean of someone who weighs 165 pounds? What is a 95% confidence interval for predicted BF% of someone who weighs 165 pounds? Interpret these intervals.\n\n\n# Intervals are given as follows:\n\nz &lt;- data.frame(Weight=165)\npredict(model, newdata = z, interval = 'confidence')\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 13.85297 9.379675 18.32627\n\npredict(model, newdata = z, interval = 'prediction')\n\n       fit       lwr      upr\n1 13.85297 -1.617547 29.32349\n\n\nWe are 95% confident the mean body fat of a person who weighs 165 pounds is in 13.8529704, 9.3796749, 18.3262658. There is a 95% probability that the body fat of a person who weights 165 pounds is in 13.8529704, -1.6175473, 29.323488 . Note that the prediction interval is wider!\n\n\n3.3.8 Homework stop 4\n\nExercise 3.15 What is the difference between a prediction interval and an interval for the mean response ?\n\n\nExercise 3.16 Code the confidence intervals for the mean response and prediction interval without using the predict function.\n\n\nExercise 3.17 Do the chapter 3 practice problems from the problem list.\n\n\n\n3.3.9 Partial testing\nWe may be interested in executing the following hypothesis test: \\[H_0\\colon (\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k)=0\\qquad vs \\qquad (\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k)\\neq 0.\\] This amounts to testing whether the subset of variables \\((\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k)\\) adds anything to the model beyond \\((\\beta_{k+1},\\ldots,\\beta_p)\\). For example, you may be interested in whether location related covariates affect the price of Airbnb. The overall idea is to compare the reduced (null) model with \\(p-k\\) covariates to the complete (saturated, full) model (which contains all covariates).\nLet’s first review the \\(F\\)-test. We learned about the \\(F\\) test, which compares the following models: \\[Y|X=\\beta^\\top X+\\epsilon \\qquad vs \\qquad  Y|X=\\beta_1+\\epsilon.\\] Here, the complete model is given by \\(Y|X=\\beta^\\top X+\\epsilon\\) and the reduced model is given by \\(Y|X=\\beta_1+\\epsilon\\). Recall that the test statistic is given by \\[\\frac{SSM/dfM}{SSE/dfE}=\\frac{( SST-SSE)/(dfT-dfE)}{SSE/dfE},\\] where the degrees of freedom are in terms of the full model (not the null model). We could then rewrite this test statistic as \\[\\frac{SSM_C/dfM_C}{SSE_C/dfE_C}=\\frac{( SST_C-SSE_C)/(dfT_C-dfE_C)}{SSE_C/dfE_C},\\] where \\(C\\) stands for the complete model. (All that has changed is the notation, we added a \\(C\\) subscript.)\nNow, note that \\(SST=\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\\bar Y)^2\\) has nothing to do with what covariates are in the model. In other words, \\(SST\\) is always the same, not matter what covariates are in the model. Therefore, \\(SST_C=SST_R=SST\\), where \\(SST_R\\) stands for the “sum of squares total” in the reduced model. In our example of the \\(F\\) test, the least squares estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) in the reduced model is \\(\\hat\\beta_1=\\bar Y\\) and the associated residual vector is given by \\(\\hat\\epsilon=Y-\\bar Y 1_n\\). But wait, observe that in this case, we have that \\(\\hat\\epsilon^\\top \\hat\\epsilon=SST!\\) Therefore, putting everything together, in this example, we have that \\(SSM_C=SST_C-SSE_C=SSE_R-SSE_C\\). That is, the model sum of squares for the complete model is the difference between the sum-squared error in the reduced model and the sum-squared error in the complete model. We can then rewrite the test statistic as \\[\\frac{( SSE_R-SSE_C)/(dfT_C-dfE_C)}{SSE_C/dfE_C}.\\] The difference \\(SSE_R-SSE_C\\) can be interpreted as the extra information gained from adding the covariates into the model OR total explained variations lost by going from the full model to the reduced model.\nThis idea can be generalized to develop a general method for testing hypotheses of the type: \\[H_0\\colon (\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\beta_k)=0\\qquad vs \\qquad (\\beta_2,\\ldots,\\beta_k)\\neq 0.\\] We complete the test as follows. Given a full model (which contains \\(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p\\)) and reduced model (which contains \\(\\{\\beta_1,\\beta_{k+1},\\ldots,\\beta_p\\}\\)), define:\n\n\\(SSE_R-SSE_C=SSdrop\\)\n\\(dfE_R-dfE_C=dfdrop\\)\n\\(MSdrop=SSdrop/dfdrop\\)\n\nThen the test statistic and p-value are given by: \\(TS=MSdrop/MSE_C\\) and \\(\\Pr\\left(F_{dfdrop,dfE_C}\\geq TS\\right)\\), respectively.\nWe can interpret \\(SSE_R-SSE_C\\) as the extra info gained from adding the extra covariates into the model OR total explained variations lost by going from the full model to the reduced model. In addition, \\(dfE_R-dfE_C=k-1\\), or the number of covariates dropped from the full model to obtain the reduced model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you take \\(k=1\\), then this is equivalent to the \\(t\\)-test!\n\n\n\n\n3.3.10 Partial coefficient of determination\nWe can define the partial coefficient of determination as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    R^2(X_1,\\ldots,X_{k-1}|X_{k},\\ldots,X_p)&=(SSE_R-SSE_C)/SSE_R\\\\\n    &=SSdrop/SSE_R.\n\\end{align*}\\] You might also see the partial correlation coefficient: \\[R(X_1,\\ldots,X_{k-1}|X_{k},\\ldots,X_p)=\\sqrt{ R^2(X_1,\\ldots,X_{k-1}|X_{k},\\ldots,X_p)}.\\]\nThis quantity is the extra proportion of variation explained from adding the covariates \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_{k-1}\\) to the model which already contains \\(X_{k},\\ldots,X_p\\).\n\nExample 3.6 A researcher ran an experiment to see if YouTube, Facebook and newspaper ads would improve sales. Run the partial \\(F\\) test to see how online advertising affects sales. Compute and interpret the following quantities:\n\n\\(SSE_R - SSE_C = SSdrop\\)\n\\(dfE_R - dfE_C = dfdrop\\)\n\\(MSdrop = SSdrop/dfdrop\\)\nTest stat: \\(TS = MSdrop/MSE_C\\)\np-value: \\(\\Pr (F_{dfdrop,dfE_C} \\geq TS)\\)\nPartial coefficient of determination\n\n\n\n# install.packages('datarium')                         \ndata(\"marketing\", package = \"datarium\")\n#printing out first few rows\nhead(marketing, 4)\n\n  youtube facebook newspaper sales\n1  276.12    45.36     83.04 26.52\n2   53.40    47.16     54.12 12.48\n3   20.64    55.08     83.16 11.16\n4  181.80    49.56     70.20 22.20\n\nplot(marketing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#setting n to be a variable (sample size)\nn=nrow(marketing)\n\n\n# Estimation: How to get an estimate $\\hat\\beta$ of $\\beta$?\n# lm( sales~   , data= marketing)\nfull_model&lt;- lm(sales ~ youtube+facebook+newspaper, data = marketing)\nsummary(full_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ youtube + facebook + newspaper, data = marketing)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-10.5932  -1.0690   0.2902   1.4272   3.3951 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

    "text": "3.4 Checking model assumptions\nWe learned how to test significance of one or multiple variables, compute confidence intervals for the estimated coefficients, mean response, and predicted response. All the methods rely on the assumptions! Recall that we assume 1. The relationship is linear \\(Y|X=X\\beta+\\epsilon,\\) 2. \\(\\forall i\\in[n]\\), \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\) 3. \\(\\epsilon_i\\perp \\epsilon_j\\) for \\(i\\neq j,\\ i,j\\in [n]\\).\nWe now briefly discuss how to use the data to check if these assumptions are appropriate. We will cover this in more detail in the next chapter.\n\n3.4.1 Checking normality\nWe do not know \\(\\epsilon\\), however, we do know \\(\\hat\\epsilon\\), which is our best proxy for the true random error vector \\(\\epsilon\\). To check if the true random error vector is normally distributed we can use histograms and quantile-quantile plots. More specifically, if the histogram of the residuals looks more or less bell-shaped, with tails similar to the normal PDF, then the assumption of normality is valid.\nRecall that a qq-plot compares the quantiles of the sample to the quantiles of the theoretical normal distribution. The x-axis represents the theoretical quantiles. The y-axis represents the sample quantiles. If the sample follows a normal distribution, the points in the qq-plot will approximately lie on a line.\nInterpretation:\n\nStraight Line: If the points lie on or near the straight line, the sample appears normal.\nHeavy Tails: Points deviating upwards or downwards at the ends suggest the sample has heavier or lighter tails than the normal distribution.\nS-Shape: Points forming an S-shape indicate the sample has lighter tails and a heavier center than the normal distribution.\n\nSee below for an example:  Note that you will always have some deviation at the ends of the line in the qq-plot.\n\nExample 3.8 In examples Example 3.1 and Example 3.6, check that the normality assumption is valid.\n\n\n# Make the data frame\nWeight=c(175 , 181 , 200 , 159 , 196 , 192 , 205 , 173 , 187 , 188 , \n         188 , 240 , 175 , 168 , 246 , 160 , 215 , 159 , 146 , 219 )\nBodyFat =c(6 , 21 , 15 , 6 , 22 , 31 , 32 ,21 , 25 , 30 , \n           10 , 20 , 22 , 9 , 38 , 10 , 27 , 12 , 10 , 28 )\n\ndf=data.frame(cbind(Weight=Weight,BodyFat=BodyFat))\nmodel= lm(BodyFat ~Weight, data = df)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = BodyFat ~ Weight, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-12.5935  -5.7904   0.6536   5.2731  10.4004 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

If the error depends on \\(\\hat y\\), then the identically distributed assumption on the errors is probably not valid. If the assumptions are valid, we should observe on the plots that at all levels of the response, the mean of the residuals is 0 and the variance remains the same. Thus, we should see a horizontal band centered at 0 containing the observations.\nThis appears to be the case in the body fat example:\n\nplot(model$fitted.values,model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that in the marketing example, the residuals admit a pattern. This usually indicates either a non-linear relationship with the covariates, or an important covariate is missing. In this case, we would say the assumption of identically distributed errors is violated.\n\nplot(full_model$fitted.values,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the residuals against the covariates can reveal dependence between the errors. For instance, if time is a covariate, you can plot the residuals over time to see if they have any relationship with time. If there appears to be dependence among the residuals, then the assumptions of the model are violated. That is, in these plots we should also see a horizontal band centered at 0 containing the observations. If not, then the residuals have a relationship with the given covariate.\n\nBe VERY careful about the scale of your plot, as it can affect your interpretation. Zooming out or in too much can make everything look fine. In addition, the \\(y\\)-axis not being centered at 0 can cause you to misinterpret the plot.\n\n\nplot(marketing$youtube,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(marketing$facebook,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(marketing$newspaper,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(marketing$youtube,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1,ylim=c(-10,10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(marketing$facebook,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1,ylim=c(-10,10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(marketing$newspaper,full_model$residuals,pch=22,bg=1,ylim=c(-10,10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the newspaper plot changes with the new axis limits. It appears that the variance of the error is changing with the value of the Facebook and Youtube budgets.\nAnother plot is that of the fitted values against the response. This gives an idea of the overall fit of the model. We should observe the points scatters around the line \\(y=x\\).\n\nplot(full_model$fitted.values,marketing$sales,pch=22,bg=1)\nabline(0,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the line is slightly curved above the line at the ends. This means that at high and low values, the actual sales are empirically greater than as predicted by the model. Let’s plot the actual data.\n\nplot(marketing,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, Youtube and Facebook spending seems to have a nonlinear relationship with sales. We will see how to remedy this in later chapters.\nAs a final note, observe that we can put the model object in the plot() function to obtain the diagnostic plots.\n\nplot(full_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will learn in later chapters how to check the assumptions more thoroughly and how to remedy violations of the assumptions.\n\n\n3.4.3 Homework stop 5\nComplete the assigned textbook problems for Chapter 4.\n\nExercise 3.19 List the assumptions for the normal MLR model and the MLR model.

A simple linear regression model is a regression model with one explanatory variable: \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i\\). \\[\ny = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right),\nX = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & x_1 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{array} \\right),\n\\beta = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{array} \\right),\n\\epsilon =  \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n\n\\end{array} \\right).\n\\]\n\n3.5.1 Estimated Coefficients\nIn this case, following some matrix manipulations (verify this for homework), we have \\[\nX^\\top X = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n & \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i & \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 \\end{array} \\right),\\\nX^\\top y = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i \\end{array} \\right).\n\\] Now, recall if \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{bmatrix} \\] then \\[ A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\begin{bmatrix}\nd & -b \\\\\n-c & a\n\\end{bmatrix}. \\]\nFrom MATH 1131 (or simple algebraic manipulation), we know \\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})  =  \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i - n\\bar{x}\\bar{y} =\n\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i - n^{-1}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \\right)\n\\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2  =  \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 - n\\bar{x}^2 =\n\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 - n^{-1}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\right)^2.\n\\end{equation*}\\] Therefore \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n(X^\\top X)^{-1} & = & \\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i)^2}\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 & - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\\\ - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i & n \\end{array} \\right) \\\\\n& = & \\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 & - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\\\ - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i & n \\end{array} \\right).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nTo summarize: \\[\\begin{align*}\nX^\\top X &=  \\begin{bmatrix} n & \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i & \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\nX^\\top y&= \\begin{bmatrix}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\n(X^\\top X)^{-1} & =  \\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 & - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\\\ - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i & n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\] Now, we have that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\hat\\beta & = & \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\hat\\beta_0 \\\\ \\hat\\beta_1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n(X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y \\\\\n& = & \\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 \\ \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i \\\\\n- \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\ \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i + n \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i \\end{array} \\right).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nNow, \\[\\hat\\beta_1=\\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\left(- \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\ \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i + n \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i\\right).\\]\n\nExercise 3.20 Let’s show that \\[\n\\hat\\beta_1 = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y _i - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\ \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}.\n\\]\n\nDoes this look familiar? We see that, \\[\n\\hat\\beta_1 = \\hat{{\\textrm{cov}}}(X,Y)\\frac{\\hat\\sigma_y}{\\hat\\sigma_x},\n\\] where \\(\\hat{{\\textrm{cov}}}(X,Y)\\) is the estimated correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Let’s interpret this:\n\nIf \\(\\hat{{\\textrm{cov}}}(X,Y)\\approx 0\\) then \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\approx 0\\) - low correlation implies an estimated slope close to 0.\nThe estimated coefficient \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) is the product of the estimated correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and the ratio of the estimated standard deviation of \\(Y\\) to that of \\(X\\).\n\nNow, looking at the intercept term, we have \\[\\hat\\beta_0=\\frac{1}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 \\ \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i - \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \\ \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i y_i\\right).\\]\n\nExercise 3.21 Show that \\[\\hat\\beta_0=\\bar y - \\hat\\beta_1\\bar x.\n\\]\n\nObserve that the intercept is the mean of \\(Y\\) minus the mean of \\(X\\) times the estimated slope. In essence, it tells us that the intercept \\((\\hat{\\beta}_0)\\) represents the value of \\((X)\\) when \\((X)\\) is at its mean value (\\((\\bar{X})\\)) and that \\((\\bar{X})\\) is adjusted by subtracting the contribution of \\((\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{X})\\).\nThis adjustment ensures that the regression line passes through the point \\(((\\bar{X}, \\bar{X}))\\), which is the point of averages for the data.\n\n\n3.5.2 Inference in SLR\nWe can also simplify the values used for inference in the SLR model. Recall that \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta\\right] = (X^\\top X)^{-1} \\sigma^2\\), and so we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_0\\right] & = & \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sigma^2\n= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2 - n \\bar{x}^2 + n \\bar{x}^2}{n \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sigma^2  \\\\\n& = & \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right] \\sigma^2  \\\\\n{\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_1\\right] & = & \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sigma^2  \\\\\n{\\textrm{cov}}({\\hat\\beta_0, \\hat\\beta_1}) & = & - \\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sigma^2.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nWe know from previous sections that a \\((1 - \\alpha)100%\\) confidence interval of \\(\\beta_i\\), where \\(i = 0, 1\\), is \\[\n\\hat\\beta_i \\pm t_{df_E, \\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_i)}.\n\\] Similarly, let \\(\\beta_i^0\\) be a hypothesized value of \\(\\beta_i\\), for \\(i=0, 1\\). If we want to test whether \\(\\beta_i=\\beta_i^0\\), then the observed test statistic is given by \\[\n\\frac{\\hat\\beta_i - \\beta_i^0}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_i)}},\n\\] and the corresponding \\(p\\)-value is obtained via the \\(t_{dfE}\\) distribution as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSimilarly, inference for the mean response and predictions can be obtained. We can also simplify the \\(ANOVA\\) table, \\(R^2\\), etc. For instance, the \\(R^2\\) is the square of the sample correlation coefficient between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Inference for the correlation coefficient\nIf we are interested in doing a hypothesis test, or constructing confidence intervals for the correlation between two variables, say \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we can use the simple linear regression model.\nWe have already derived the relationship between the estimated correlation coefficient and the estimated slope of the simple linear regression model. More specifically, if the estimated correlation coefficient is 0, then the estimated slope of the simple linear regression is 0. One can show that the same relationship holds at the population level: \\(\\beta_1=\\rho \\sigma_y/\\sigma_x\\), where \\(\\rho={\\textrm{corr}}\\left[X,Y\\right]\\).\nNow, suppose that we want to test if \\(H_0: \\rho =0\\) versus \\(H_a: \\rho \\neq 0\\). Using the fact that \\(\\beta_1=\\rho \\sigma_y/\\sigma_x\\), the above test is equivalent to the statement \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). Therefore, we can just test if the slope parameter in the model \\(Y|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X+\\epsilon\\) is 0.\nLetting \\(\\hat\\rho=\\hat{{\\textrm{corr}}}(X,Y)\\) The observed test statistic is then: \\[\n\\frac{\\hat\\beta_1}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{var}(\\hat\\beta_1)}} = \\frac{\\hat\\rho \\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\hat\\rho^2}},\n\\] and the corresponding \\(p\\)-value is obtained based on the \\(t_{dfE}\\) distribution.\nHowever, when the hypothesized value for \\(\\rho\\) is non-zero, the problem becomes very complicated. The exact distribution of \\(\\hat\\rho\\) is extremely difficult to obtain under the null hypothesis. The following procedure gives an approximation of the distribution of a function of \\(\\hat\\rho\\) under the null hypothesis. In particular, Fisher suggested the transformation for \\(\\rho \\in (0, 1)\\), \\[\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\frac{1 + \\rho}{1 - \\rho}.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\hat\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\frac{1 + \\hat\\rho}{1 - \\hat\\rho},\n\\] is an estimate of \\(\\theta\\), where \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is approximately distributed as normal with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\frac{1}{n-3}\\). Hence, an approximate \\((1 - \\alpha)100%\\) confidence interval of \\(\\theta\\) is \\[\n\\hat\\theta \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-3}},\n\\] and the corresponding confidence interval of \\(\\rho\\) can be obtained by the inverse transformation. Similarly, if the hypothesized value of \\(\\rho\\) is \\(\\rho_0\\), then the hypothesized value of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\theta_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\frac{1 + \\rho_0}{1-\\rho_0}\\). The observed test statistic can be obtained and the corresponding \\(p\\)-value can be obtained based on the standard normal distribution.\n\nExample 3.9 In Example 3.1 test if the correlation between body fat and weight is 0.

It is very possible that a model that fits well in the region of the original data will perform poorly outside that region. It is easy to inadvertently extrapolate, since the levels of the regressors jointly define a region containing the data which is impossible to visualize in its entirety beyond 2 dimensions. Ideally, we want to make inferences which lie inside the convex hull of the regressors.\nWe can use the diagonal of the hat matrix \\(H=X(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top\\). In general, the point that has the largest value of \\(h_{ii}\\), say \\(h_{max}\\), will lie on the boundary of the convex hull in a region of the \\(x\\)-space where the density of the observations is relatively low. Points that lie in the set \\(\\{x^\\top (X^\\top X)^{-1} x\\leq h_{max}\\}\\) enclose the convex hull. Thus, for a value we are interested in predicting, say \\(y\\), we can check if we are extrapolating with \\(y^\\top (X^\\top X)^{-1} y\\leq h_{max}\\).\n\n\nA serious problem that may dramatically impact the usefulness of a regression model is multicollinearity, or near - linear dependence among the regression variables. Multicollinearity implies near - linear dependence among the regressors. The regressors are the columns of the \\(X\\) matrix, so clearly an exact linear dependence would result in a singular \\(X^\\top X\\). This will impact our ability to estimate \\(\\beta\\).\nWe can check for this dependence with the variance inflation factor (VIF). The variance inflation factor can be written as \\((1-R^2_j)^{-1}\\), where \\(R^2_j\\) is the coefficient of determination obtained from regressing \\(X_j\\) on the other regressor variables. If VIF is large, say \\(&gt;3\\), then you will likely need to make some changes to your regression model.\n\n\nSometimes, you may observe that regression coefficients have the a sign that is unexpected, or contradicts nature. This is likely due to one of the following:\n\nThe range of some of the regressors is too small – if the range of some of the regressors is too small, then the variance of \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is high.\nImportant regressors have not been included in the model.\nMulticollinearity is present.\nComputational errors have been made.\n\n\nWe close this Chapter with the following statement. Recall the modelling overview from Chapter 1:\n\nPosit the model: What is the linear regression model – what are all the assumptions of the linear regression model?\nEstimation: How can we estimate parameters of the linear regression model?\nInference: How can we compute confidence intervals and run hypothesis tests associated with the linear regression model?\nFit: Does our fitted line match up with the data? What about the normality assumption? Do the errors appear normal? Do the errors seem independent? Is the variance constant? How much variability is explained by our model?\nPrediction: How can we predict a new \\(Y\\)? What is the error of this prediction\n\nIf you have learned the concepts of this chapter, you should be able to complete all of these steps! In the following chapters, we will discuss different problems that can arise in regression modelling and how to remedy them.\n\n\n3.6.2 Homework questions\n\nExercise 3.23 Show \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat Y|X\\right]=\\sigma^2 H\\).\n\n\nExercise 3.24 Check for multicolinearity in our past examples.\n\n\nExercise 3.25 Complete the problem sets from Chapter’s 2, 3 and 4!",

    "section": "4.2 Types of residuals",
    "text": "4.2 Types of residuals\nWe will refer to \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i\\) as simply the residuals, or ordinary residuals when we need to be extra clear.\nThe standardized residual is given by \\[d_i=\\hat\\epsilon_i/\\sqrt{MSE}.\\] This is an approximate \\(Z\\)-score for the residuals, since the residuals have 0 mean, the \\(MSE\\) is approximately the variance of the random error and the residuals approximate the random error. We say that large \\(d_i\\) (\\(&gt;3\\)) indicates an outlier, though, we may want to use a more robust measure of the variance. We will generally prefer to use a different type of residual, which we now present.\nWe now introduce the hat matrix: \\(H=X(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top\\). Note that \\(H\\) is symmetric and idempotent. The hat matrix appears often in regression analysis, and you should remember this quantity. It is called the hat matrix because \\(\\hat Y=H Y\\).\nNote that the eigenvalues of \\(H\\), and any idempotent matrix \\(A\\) are either \\(0\\) or 1: \\[ \\lambda x=A x=A^2 x=A\\lambda x=\\lambda^2 x,\\] which implies that \\(\\lambda\\in\\{0,1\\}\\).\n\nExercise 4.1 Verify that \\(H\\) is symmetric and idempotent and that \\(\\hat Y=H Y\\), where one recalls that a matrix \\(A\\) is idempotent if \\(AA=A\\).\n\nNow, note that: \\[\\hat\\epsilon=(I-H)Y=(I-H)\\epsilon.\\]\n\nExercise 4.2 Verify that \\(\\hat\\epsilon=(I-H)Y=(I-H)\\epsilon.\\).\n\nUsing this identity, we have that \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\epsilon\\right]=(I-H)\\epsilon(I-H)^\\top=(I-H)\\sigma^2.\\)\nThe fact that \\(H\\) is symmetric and idempotent implies that its diagonal elements are between 0 and 1. It follows that the elements on the diagonal of \\((I-H)\\) are also between 0 and 1. Therefore, the \\(MSE\\) overestimates the variance of the residuals: the variance of residual \\(i\\) is given by \\((1-h_{ii})\\sigma^2&lt;\\sigma^2\\approx MSE\\). Here, \\(h_{ii}\\) denotes the \\(i\\)th diagonal element of the matrix \\(H\\).\nFurthermore, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of the location of the \\(i\\)th point in \\(x\\)-space, \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\epsilon_i\\right]\\) depends on where \\(X_i\\) lies. Points near the center of the \\(x\\)-space have larger variance than residuals at more remote locations. What do you think about this?\nNow, intuitively, violations of model assumptions would be more likely to occur at remote points. However, the variance of the ordinary residuals is lower at these points. Therefore, these violations may be hard to detect from inspection of the ordinary residuals because their residuals will often be smaller.\nTherefore, we will call points that are outlying in the \\(x\\)-space leverage points. We will refer to influence points as points that are not only remote in terms of the \\(x\\)-space, but also the observed response for that point is not consistent with the response that would be predicted for that point, using only the other data points.\nIn the example below, observe that the right-most point is both a leverage and influential point.\n\n########## \n# Simulate some data\nset.seed(330)\nx=c(rnorm(6),2.5)\ny=x*2+3\ny[7]=y[7]+7\n\n# Plot the data and fitted lines\nplot(x,y,pch=22,bg=1)\na=lm(y~x)\ncurve(a$coefficients[1]+x*a$coefficients[2],add=T,lwd=3)\ncurve(x*2+3,add=T,col=2,lwd=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   2.048937    3.979977 \n\n\nLet \\(\\hat Y^*_n\\) be the estimate of \\(Y_n\\) based on the other data and let \\(\\delta_n=Y_n-\\hat Y^*_n\\). Note that one can show that \\(\\hat Y_n=\\hat Y^*_n+h_{nn}\\delta_n\\). Next, we know that if \\(X_n\\) is outlying, i.e., \\(||X_n||\\) is large, then \\(h_{nn}\\approx 1\\). This implies that \\(\\hat Y_n\\approx Y_n\\), which means that the regression line is dragged to pass through \\((X_n,Y_n)\\).\nTo detect these types of outlying points, it makes sense to then define the studentized residuals: \\[r_i=\\frac{\\hat\\epsilon_i}{\\sqrt{MSE(1-h_{ii})}}.\\]\nThe studentized residuals in the simple linear regression model reduce to \\[\nr_i=\\frac{\\hat\\epsilon_i}{\\sqrt{MSE}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(X_i-\\bar{X}\\right)^2}{\\sum (X-\\bar X)^2}\\right)\\right]}.\n\\] Observe that as \\(X_i\\) grows large, we have that \\(\\frac{\\left(X_i-\\bar{X}\\right)^2}{\\sum (X-\\bar X)^2}\\to 1\\), which implies that \\(\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(X_i-\\bar{X}\\right)^2}{\\sum (X-\\bar X)^2}\\right)\\right]\\to 0\\) and \\(r_i\\to \\infty\\). On the other hand, as \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i\\) grows large, we have that \\(r_i\\) grows large. Therefore, the studentized residual will be large for observations with large ordinary residuals, and for leverage observations.\nEarlier, we presented \\(\\delta_i\\), the difference between the response of the \\(i\\)th observation and the predicted response based on the observations with the \\(i\\)th points removed. These are known as the PRESS residuals. This seems hard computationally, but one can show that\n\\[\n\\delta_i=\\frac{\\hat\\epsilon_i}{1-h_{ii}} .\n\\] Note that when \\(h_{ii}\\) is large, this indicates a highly influential point. Observe that a large PRESS residual \\(\\delta_i\\), but small ordinary residual \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i\\), indicates that the model fit without \\((X_i,Y_i)\\) predicts \\(Y_i\\) poorly.\n\nExercise 4.3 Show that standardizing the PRESS residual, that is, dividing the PRESS residual by its standard deviation, results in \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i/\\sqrt{\\sigma^2(1-h_{ii})}\\). Compare this to the studentized residual.\n\nLastly, if we believe that \\((X_i,Y_i)\\) is outlying, then we can also leave \\((X_i,Y_i)\\) out in the MSE calculation. This results in the R-studentized residuals: \\[\n\\tilde r_i=\\frac{\\hat\\epsilon_i}{\\sqrt{\\widetilde{MSE}_i(1-h_{ii})}},\n\\] where \\(\\widetilde{MSE}_i\\) is the mean squared error computed from the regression model with \\((X_i,Y_i)\\) excluded: \\[\\widetilde{MSE}_{i}=\\frac{(n-p+1) MSE-\\hat \\epsilon_i^2 /\\left(1-h_{i i}\\right)}{n-p}.\\]",

    "text": "5.1 Variance-stabilizing transformations\nRecall that we assume that \\(\\forall i\\in[n]\\), \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\). A common reason for a violation of this assumption is for \\(Y\\) to have a distribution in which the variance is related to its mean. For example, if the response \\(Y\\) is a Poisson random variable, i.e., \\[Y|X\\sim Pois(X\\beta),\\] then we have that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y\\right]=X\\beta\\), then \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y\\right]={\\textrm{Var}}\\left[Y\\right]=X\\beta\\). In this case, the simple linear regression assumptions are violated. In particular, the variance is not the same for each observation. Here, it happens that taking the response to be roughly \\(\\sqrt{Y}\\) fixes the problem. That is, performing the regression analysis with \\(\\sqrt{Y}\\) as the response variable instead of \\(Y\\), ensures that the regression assumptions are (approximately) satisfied. This example gives rise to the idea of transformations. If our data do not satisfy the assumptions for the MLR or the normal MLR, we might ask if there is some transformation of either the response, some of the covariates, or both that make the data suitable for a MLR analysis. Note that the assumptions are important. For instance, if the variance is not homogeneous, the OLS estimator will still be unbiased, but they will no longer have BLUE property. That means that some other estimator will work better for such data!\nWhich transformation should we choose? Sometimes, we can use prior experience or theoretical considerations to guide us in selecting an appropriate transformation. Other times, we must choose it empirically, i.e., based on the data. Often, the square root and the logarithm are popular choices. If you response is between 0 and 1, and the data appear to be “football shaped”, then you may like to take the \\(\\arcsin(\\sqrt{Y})\\).\nWe now demonstrate what one of these relationships looks like in simple linear regression. We now simulate a dataset where \\(\\sigma^2\\propto {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y|X\\right]\\), and plot \\(X\\) against \\(Y\\). We use the Poisson example discussed previously.\nset.seed(2352)\nn=1000\nX=runif(n,5,10)*2\nY=20*rpois(n,X)+2\nplot(X,Y)\n# Performing a regression analysis yields: \nmodel=lm(Y~X)\n# Notice the intercept is poorly estimated! \nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Y ~ X)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-250.289  -53.392   -2.127   48.795  270.716 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It is a good time to recall that in general, for a real function \\(f\\), we have that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[f(X)\\right]\\neq f({\\textrm{E}}\\left[X\\right])\\). For instance, for many random variables \\(Z\\), we would have that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Z^2\\right]\\neq {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Z\\right]^2\\), \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\log Z\\right]\\neq \\log {\\textrm{E}}\\left[Z\\right]\\) etc. .\nIn a transformed regression model, we fit the following model: \\[f(Y)=X\\beta+\\epsilon.\\] If we are interested in predicting the value of \\(Y\\) given \\(z\\), then it seems natural to take the predictions for \\(f(Y)\\) given \\(z\\), which are given by \\(\\beta^\\top z\\) and apply the inverse transformation \\(f^{-1}\\). For instance, to predict \\(Y|Z=z\\), we may compute: \\(f^{-1}(\\beta^\\top z)\\). It turns out, this prediction is biased, and we should use a different method instead.\nTo see why it’s biased, observe that the predictions from the model \\(f(Y)=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\) for a new set of covariates \\(z\\) are given by \\(\\hat f(Y)=\\hat\\beta^\\top z\\approx{\\textrm{E}}\\left[f(Y)|Z=z\\right]\\). Now, we have that \\[f^{-1}(\\hat\\beta^\\top z)\\approx f^{-1}({\\textrm{E}}\\left[f(Y)|Z=z\\right])\\neq {\\textrm{E}}\\left[f^{-1}(f(Y))|Z=z\\right]= {\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\hat f(Y)|Z=z\\right].\\]\nThe solution to this problem is to adjust for the bias. For the log transform, we can multiply the resulting inverse transformed predictions by \\(\\exp(\\hat\\sigma^2/2)\\). For the square root transformation, we add \\(\\hat\\sigma^2\\) to the resulting inverse transformed predictions. See (Miller 1984) for more information.\nOne can also use confidence and prediction intervals to predict the value of \\(Y\\) given \\(z\\). Confidence or prediction intervals may be directly converted from one metric to another – such interval estimates are percentiles of a distribution which are unaffected by the transformation. They can be converted back to the original units via the inverse transformation and the interpretation will remain the same. Optimal intervals are intervals with the shortest average interval length for a given confidence level, under a given set of assumptions. However, it may be that the resulting intervals may not be “optimal”. One way to get a prediction in the original units, is to apply the inverse transformation to the prediction interval computed from the transformed model and take the midpoint of that interval.

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nIt is often necessary to convert any predicted values back to the original units. Applying the inverse transformation to predicted values gives an estimate of the median of the distribution of the (untransformed) response – instead of the mean. This implies that predictions are generally biased. Prediction and confidence intervals do not suffer this illness. They can be converted back to the original units via the inverse transformation and the interpretation will remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.1 Let’s simulate what happens when, given the day \\(t\\in [100]\\), we try to estimate the mean stock price \\(P_t\\) for some stock (maybe ?Gamestop?) in a model which regresses the logged rate of return against the day. Note that the logged returns at time \\(t\\) are given by: \\(L=\\log\\left(\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\\right)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.2 An electric utility is interested in developing a model relating peak - hour demand \\(Y\\) to total energy usage during the month \\(X\\). This is an important planning problem because while most customers pay directly for energy usage (in kilowatt - hours), the generation system must be large enough to meet the maximum demand imposed. Data for 53 residential customers for the month of August is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Linearizing the model\nMoving on, we may suspect that the relationship between the regressors and the response is nonlinear, either through empirical evidence or theoretical justification. In some cases a nonlinear function can be linearized by using a suitable transformation. Such nonlinear models are called intrinsically linear. For example, consider the model \\(Y=\\beta_0e^{\\beta_1 X}\\epsilon\\). Taking the log of both sides yields: \\[\\log(Y)=\\log(\\beta_0)+\\beta_1 X+\\log(\\epsilon).\\] Reparameterizing with \\(Z=\\log(Y)\\), \\(\\alpha_0=\\log(\\beta_0)\\) and \\(\\eta=\\log(\\epsilon)\\), we have that\n\\[Z=\\alpha_0+\\beta_1 X+\\eta.\\] If we are willing to assume that \\(\\eta\\) are symmetric about 0 with a constant variance, then we can run a linear regression with the model given above. To get estimates for the original units \\(Y\\), we can transform back as previously discussed. A model is linearizable if there exists some reparameterization which places the model in the form of the MLR.\n\nExercise 5.1 Show the following models are linearizable - that is, find the linear reparameterization of the following models: 1. \\(Y=\\beta_0 X^\\beta_1\\) 2. \\(Y=\\beta_0 X^{\\beta_1X}\\) 3. \\(Y=\\beta_0+ \\log X\\) 4. \\(Y=X/(\\beta_0 X-\\beta_1)\\)\n\n\nExample 5.3 A research engineer is investigating the use of a windmill to generate electricity.

Looking at the scatterplot, we might initially consider using a quadratic model to account for the pictured curvature. However, the scatterplot suggests that as wind speed increases, DC output approaches an upper limit of approximately 2.5. This is also consistent with the theory of windmill operation. Since the quadratic model will eventually bend downward as wind speed increases, it would not be appropriate for these data. A more reasonable model for the windmill data that incorporates an upper asymptote would be based on \\(1/X\\).\n\nplot(df_wind$DCOutput,1/df_wind$WindVelocity_mph,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# plot(df$DCOutput,log(df$WindVelocity_mph))\ndf_wind$WindVelocity_mph_inv=1/df_wind$WindVelocity_mph\nmodel2=lm(DCOutput~WindVelocity_mph_inv, df_wind)\nmodel2\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = DCOutput ~ WindVelocity_mph_inv, data = df_wind)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  WindVelocity_mph_inv  \n               2.979                -6.935  \n\nsumm=summary(model2); summ\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = DCOutput ~ WindVelocity_mph_inv, data = df_wind)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.20547 -0.04940  0.01100  0.08352  0.12204 \n\nCoefficients:\n                     Estimate Std.

Consider the class of transformations: \\(\\{y^\\lambda\\colon \\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}\\). The regression model and \\(\\lambda\\) can be estimated simultaneously using the method of maximum likelihood. Recall that we used the method of least squares to estimate the model parameters - maximum likelihood is an alternative estimation strategy. Think of \\(\\lambda\\) like an extra model parameter, on top of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) that we need to estimate.\nLet \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\tilde y&=\\log^{-1}(1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\log y_i)\\\\\n    y_\\lambda&=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{y^\\lambda-1}{\\lambda\\tilde y^{\\lambda-1}}& \\lambda\\neq 0\\\\\n\\tilde y\\log y& \\lambda= 0\n\\end{cases}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe then fit the following model \\[y_\\lambda=X\\beta+\\epsilon.\\]\nEven though \\(y^\\lambda \\neq y_\\lambda\\), we use \\(y^\\lambda\\) (or \\(\\log y\\) if \\(\\lambda=0\\)) as the final response - as it is more interpretable. It is entirely acceptable to use \\(y_\\lambda\\) as the response for the final model - this model will have a scale difference and an origin shift in comparison to the model using \\(y^\\lambda\\) (or \\(\\log y\\)). Usually the final \\(\\lambda\\) used in the model is rounded to a nice number for interpretation. A computational procedure is used for estimating \\(\\lambda\\), which we will not cover here. In general, we can compute a confidence interval for \\(\\lambda\\), and if it contains 1 then we may not need to transform.\n\nExample 5.4 Let’s apply the Box-Cox transformation to the two previous examples.\n\nThe R function boxcox from the MASS package can be used to execute the Box-Cox transformation. It requires you to specify a grid of points for \\(\\lambda\\), given below by seq(-2, 2, 1/10). We can set the plotit parameter to TRUE in order to see if this grid is big enough. We should see a peak or mode in the log-likelihood function that is plotted. If we don’t, we can expand the grid on the side which has the largest value of the log-likelihood. Observe below that we need to include points higher than 2 on the grid, as the function is still increasing for at \\(\\lambda=2\\):\n\n# You need the MASS package. \n# install.packages('MASS')\n\nbc=MASS::boxcox(DCOutput~WindVelocity_mph,data=df_wind,    \n       lambda = seq(-2, 2, 1/10), \n       plotit = TRUE,         \n       eps = 1/50,     \n       xlab = expression(lambda), \n       ylab = \"log-Likelihood\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# bc\n\n#Observe that \n\nbc=MASS::boxcox(DCOutput~WindVelocity_mph,data=df_wind,    \n                lambda = seq(0, 5, 1/10), \n                plotit = TRUE,         \n                eps = 1/50,     \n                xlab = expression(lambda), \n                ylab = \"log-Likelihood\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# bc\n\n#Seems like we should try lambda=2 \n\nThe confidence interval goes from just below 2 to just below 3.

    "text": "6.1 What are indicator variables?\nIf a regressor has two categories \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that regressor can be included in the model as\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\nz= \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if the observation is type A } \\\\ 1 & \\text { if the observation is type B }\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\\] Sometimes people choose \\[\\begin{equation*}\nz= \\begin{cases}-1 & \\text { if the observation is type A } \\\\ 1 & \\text { if the observation is type B }\\end{cases}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThe variable \\(z\\) is an indicator variable. Indicator variables are in numeric form, and can therefore be included in the design matrix \\(X\\) in the usual way we do for continuous regressors.\nWe have that \\[\\begin{equation*}\nX_{2i}= \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if the subject $i$ is male } \\\\ 1 &  \\text { if the subject $i$ is female }\\end{cases}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThe regression equation is then \\[Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\beta_2X_{i2}+\\epsilon_i,\\] where \\(X_{i1}\\) is the weight of individual \\(i\\).\nWhen \\(X_{i2}=0\\), then the regression equation for males is given by \\(Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\epsilon_i\\). Therefore, the expected body fat percentage for males is \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i|X\\right]=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}\\). Additionally, when \\(X_{i2}=1\\), then the regression equation for females is given by \\(Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\beta_2+\\epsilon_i\\). It follows that the expected body fat percentage for females is \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i|X\\right]=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\beta_2\\). Thus, we have that the expected body fat percentage for females is \\(\\beta_2\\) higher than for males, holding weight constant. This is the interpretation of the coefficient for the dummy variable in this case. Observe that for males and females, the regression lines are parallel. The model says that sex accounts for a constant shift in your expected body fat, but the slope (the coefficient for weight) of the regression line remains the same.\nLet’s observe.\n# Make the data frame\nWeight=c(175 , 181 , 200 , 159 , 196 , 192 , 205 , 173 , 187 , 188 , \n         188 , 240 , 175 , 168 , 246 , 160 , 215 , 159 , 146 , 219 )\nBodyFat =c(6 , 21 , 15 , 6 , 22 , 31 , 32 ,21 , 25 , 30 , \n           10 , 20 , 22 , 9 , 38 , 10 , 27 , 12 , 10 , 28 )\nSex=c(\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\")\n\ndf=data.frame(Weight=Weight,BodyFat=BodyFat,Sex=Sex,stringsAsFactors = T)\n\ndf$Sex=relevel(df$Sex,\"M\")\n\nmod=lm(BodyFat~Weight+Sex,data=df)\nsummary(mod)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = BodyFat ~ Weight + Sex, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-11.2198  -5.3804  -0.1767   3.6719  11.7136 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

In the case of two categories, the interpretation of the coefficient for the dummy variable is given as follows: Holding other regressors constant, on average, the change in response attributed to the case where the dummy variable is 1, relative to the case where the dummy variable is 0, is given by the coefficient for the dummy variable.\nMoving on, a regressor that has \\(k\\) categories can be represented by \\(k-1\\) indicator variables:\nIn this case, the category, or level, where all dummy variables are equal to 0 is the reference category. The reference category is the baseline we will compare all other categories to. You may want to choose this carefully. In this case, the interpretation of each of the \\(k-1\\) coefficients is going to be as follows: Holding other regressors constant, on average, the change in response attributed to the case where the dummy variable corresponding to the coefficient is 1, relative to the reference category, is given by the coefficient for the dummy variable.

    "section": "6.2 Interaction effects",
    "text": "6.2 Interaction effects\nAn interaction effect occurs when the effect of one regressor on the response depends on the value of another regressor. In other words, the combined effect of two variables is not simply additive; the value of one variable modifies the impact of the other. In linear regression, this means that the coefficient of one regressor depends on the other.\nWe now give a simple example:\nSuppose we are studying the effect of hours studied (\\(X_1\\)) and attendance (\\(X_2\\)) on exam scores (\\(Y\\)). An interaction effect between \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) would imply that the effect of studying on exam scores is different depending on the level of attendance. This can be modeled by including an interaction term (\\(X_1 \\times X_2\\)) in the regression equation:\n[ Y_i = 0 + 1 X{1i} + 2 X{2i} + 3 (X{1i} X{2i}) + _i. ]\nThe coefficient (_3) represents the interaction effect between X1 and X2. For instance, if \\(\\beta_3&gt;0\\), then the more the student has attended the course, the more beneficial the student’s hours studied will be.\nSome examples of how interaction effects are applied in real life are given by:\n\nPsychology: Studying how different treatments and demographic factors interact to influence behavior.\nMarketing: Analyzing how different marketing strategies and customer demographics interact to affect sales.\nMedicine: Investigating how different drugs and patient characteristics interact to affect health outcomes.\n\n\nExample 6.3 Let’s recall Example 6.1 and suppose the researcher would like you to include the interaction effect between Weight and Sex. Explain how the regression line changes with a non-zero interaction effect. Interpret the estimated interaction effect. Is it significant?\n\nThe regression equation is \\[Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\beta_2X_{i2}+\\beta_3X_{i1}X_{i2}+\\epsilon_i.\\] If \\(\\beta_3\\neq 0\\) then we proceed as follows. When \\(X_{i2}=0\\), then the regression equation for males is still given by \\(Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\epsilon_i\\). Therefore, the expected body fat percentage for males is \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i|X\\right]=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}\\). Additionally, when \\(X_{i2}=1\\), then the regression equation for females is given by \\[Y_i|X=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{i1}+\\beta_2+\\beta_3X_{i1}+\\epsilon_i=\\beta_0+(\\beta_1+\\beta_3)X_{i1}+\\beta_2+\\epsilon_i.\\] It follows that the expected body fat percentage for females is \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i|X\\right]=\\beta_0+(\\beta_1+\\beta_3)X_{i1}+\\beta_2\\). Thus, adding an interaction effect allows the model to generate a completely different regression line, that is a different slope and intercept for females. The expected body fat percentage for females is then \\(\\beta_2+\\beta_3X_{i1}\\) higher than for males, holding weight constant. Adding an interaction effect allows the slope to also vary, depending on whether the subject is male or female.\nLet’s observe.\n\n# Make the data frame\nWeight=c(175 , 181 , 200 , 159 , 196 , 192 , 205 , 173 , 187 , 188 , \n         188 , 240 , 175 , 168 , 246 , 160 , 215 , 159 , 146 , 219 )\nBodyFat =c(6 , 21 , 15 , 6 , 22 , 31 , 32 ,21 , 25 , 30 , \n           10 , 20 , 22 , 9 , 38 , 10 , 27 , 12 , 10 , 28 )\nSex=c(\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\")\n\ndf=data.frame(Weight=Weight,BodyFat=BodyFat,Sex=Sex,stringsAsFactors = T)\n\ndf$Sex=relevel(df$Sex,\"M\")\n\nmod=lm(BodyFat~Weight+Sex+Weight*Sex,data=df)\nsummary(mod)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = BodyFat ~ Weight + Sex + Weight * Sex, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-11.4171  -5.3084   0.1178   3.4912  11.7087 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Now, the estimated interaction effect is 0.01987. Let’s interpret it. We have that, on average, for every one lb increase in weight, the body fat percentage of a female increases by 0.01987 more than that of a male.\n(In this case, the term is not significant, so we would probably drop it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe can include interaction effects in the regression model in R by adding variable_1*variable_2 to the right-hand side of the formula equation.\n\n\n\nExample 6.4 When evaluating factors that affect the price of real estate, we may wish to consider location, while adjusting for lot size, year built and finished square feet. The data set clean_data.csv contains the prices of various types of real estate, as well as several important regressors.

In addition, note that year built has a positive coefficient of 785$. We can interpret the interaction effect as follows: Holding finished square feet and lot size constant, a one year increase in year built for a home in District 14 results in an increase in price that is \\(723.1\\) lower than that of District 1. We can also reword this to make it a little more clear - Holding finished square feet and lot size constant, a one year increase in year built for a home in District 1 results in an increase in price that is \\(723.1\\) higher than that of District 1.\nTo see this observe that for a one unit increase in year built in District 14, we have that the price goes up by 785.0-723.1=61.9 on average, holding other variables constant. On the other hand, in District 1, the price goes up by 785.0 on average, holding other variables constant. Therefore, in general, newer homes are much more valuable in District 1.\n\nExercise 6.1 Interpret the main effects and the interaction effect with year built for Districts 2-4. (The main effects are the coefficients for Districts 2-4.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe interpretation for interaction effects is difficult and nuanced.

    "text": "6.3 Increasing codes and quantitative regressors via dummy variables\nAnother approach to the treatment of a qualitative variable in regression is to measure the levels of the variable by an allocated code. Suppose we model the effect of the number of bedrooms on real estate price by its numerical value, instead of categorical value. Let’s see what happens to the regression equation. In general, ordinal variables may be better represented by dummy variables/indicators - however, dummy variables increase the complexity of the model, which we may not have enough data to support, and could lead to overfitting.\n\nExample 6.5 When evaluating factors that affect the price of real estate, we may wish to consider the unadjusted effect of the number of bedrooms. Regress the sale price on number of bedrooms treating number of bedrooms as a continuous variable. Then, regress the sale price on number of bedrooms treating number of bedrooms as a categorical variable.

On the other hand, the categorical model says that the change in price depends on the number of bedrooms. For example, going from 0 bedrooms to 1 bedroom, we actually see a reduction in price of -33 909$. Let’s graph the expected price for each number of bedrooms from both models:\n\n####### Fitting the model  ##############\nnew_dat=data.frame('Bdrms'=sort(unique(df_clean3$Bdrms)))\nnew_dat2=data.frame('Bdrms2'=0:8)\n# predict(model_ca,new_dat)\n# predict(model_co,new_dat2)\n\nobserved_means=aggregate(Sale_price~Bdrms,data=df_clean3, FUN = \"mean\")\nplot(observed_means[,1],observed_means[,2],pch=25,bg=1,cex=3,ylim=c( 70000,300000))\npoints(x=observed_means[,1],predict(model_ca,new_dat),pch=21,bg=2,cex=2)\npoints(x=observed_means[,1],predict(model_co,new_dat2),pch=22,bg=3,cex=2)\nlegend(\"topleft\",legend=c(\"Observed means\",\"Cat. model\",\"Cont. model\"),pch=c(21,21,22),pt.bg=c(1,2,3),cex=1.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that the continuous model does not match the data at all, while the categorical model is able to model the non-linear relationship between the number of bedrooms and the sale price! Why is this the case? Treating a regressor as continuous implies that there is a linear relationship between that regressor and the response. On the other hand, modelling the variable with indicators does not place any assumption on the relationship between the regressor and the response. The drawback, is that we need 7 more parameters in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen deciding to treat continuous or ordinal variables as continuous, it is critical that you evaluate whether it is acceptable to assume a linear relationship between the regression and the response. If you cannot verify this assumption, or it seems invalid, it is best to treat the regressor as categorical.\n\n\nQuantitative regressors can also be represented by indicator variables. Sometimes this is necessary because it is difficult to collect accurate information on the quantitative regressor, or the exact values are obscured for privacy reasons. Treating a quantitative factor as a qualitative one increases the complexity of the model. This approach also reduces the degrees of freedom for error. However, the indicator variable approach does not require the analyst to make any prior assumptions about the functional form of the relationship between the response and the regressor variable, as previously discussed.",

    "text": "7.1 Influential observations and leverage\nRecall that violations of model assumptions are more likely at remote points, and these violations may be hard to detect from inspection of the ordinary residuals because their residuals will usually be smaller. Points that are outlying in the \\(x\\)-direction are known as leverage points. Influential points are not only remote in terms of the specific values for the regressors, but the observed response is not consistent with the values that would be predicted based on only the other data points. It is important to find these influential points and assess their impact on the model.\nBelow gives an example of an influential point. The seventh point in the data set is outlying in the \\(x\\)-direction, and it’s response value is not consistent with the regression line based on the other six observations:\nset.seed(330)\nx=c(rnorm(6),2.5)\ny=x*2+3\ny[7]=y[7]+7\nplot(x,y,pch=22,bg=1)\na=lm(y~x)\ncurve(a$coefficients[1]+x*a$coefficients[2],add=T,lwd=3)\ncurve(x*2+3,add=T,col=2,lwd=3)\n\na2=lm(y[-7]~x[-7])\ncurve(a2$coefficients[1]+x*a2$coefficients[2],add=T,lwd=3,col='blue',lty=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   2.048937    3.979977\nSometimes we find that a regression coefficient may have a sign that does not make engineering or scientific sense, a regressor known to be important may be statistically insignificant, or a model that fits the data well and that is logical from an application – environment perspective may produce poor predictions. These situations may be the result of one or, perhaps, a few influential observations.\nRecall the hat matrix \\(H=X(X^\\top X)^{-1}X^\\top\\), as well as that it holds that \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\epsilon\\right]=\\sigma^2(I-H)\\) and \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat Y\\right]=\\sigma^2 H\\). Note that \\(h_{ij}\\) can be interpreted as the amount of leverage exerted by the \\(ith\\) observation \\(y_i\\) on the \\(jth\\) fitted value \\(\\hat y_j\\). We usually focus attention on the diagonal elements \\(h_{ii}\\) of the hat matrix \\(H\\), which may be written as \\[h_{ii}=x_i^\\top (X^\\top X)^{-1} x_i,\\] where \\(X_i^\\top\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of \\(X\\). The hat matrix diagonal is a standardized measure of the distance of the \\(i\\)th observation from the center (or centroid) of the \\(x\\)-space. Therefore, large values of \\(h_{ii}\\) implies that \\(x_i\\) is potentially influential. Furthermore, note that \\(rank(H)=p\\) since the trace of an idempotent matrix equals its rank, which means that \\(\\bar h= p/n\\). It follows that values well above \\(p/n\\), say \\(h_{ii}&gt;2p/n\\), can be called leverage points.\nX=as.matrix(cbind(rep(1,length(x)),x))\n# or\n\nX=model.matrix(a)\nhat=X%*%solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)\n\ndiag(hat)\n\n        1         2         3         4         5         6         7 \n0.2027453 0.2288737 0.2596869 0.1751432 0.1735495 0.3887329 0.5712686 \n\np=2\nn=7\ndiag(hat)&gt;2*p/n\n\n    1     2     3     4     5     6     7 \nFALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE",

    "text": "7.2 Cook’s Distance\nCook’s Distance is one way to incorporate both the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) values into an outlyingness measure: \\[\nD_i\\left(X^{\\top} X, p, MSE\\right) \\equiv D_i=\\frac{\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{(i)}-\\hat{\\beta}\\right)^{\\top} X^{\\top} X\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{(i)}-\\hat{\\beta}\\right)}{p MSE}, \\  i=\\in [n],\n\\] where \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{(i)}\\) is the OLS estimator with the \\(i\\)th point removed.Large values of Cook’s distance signal a leverage point.\nWhat do we mean by a large value? We can compare \\(D_i\\) to the 50th percentile of the \\(F_{p,n-p}\\) distribution. This gives the interpretation that deleting the \\(i\\)th point moves the estimate to the boundary of a 50% confidence interval. \\(F_{p,n-p}\\approx 1\\), and so usually take \\(D_i\\geq 1\\) to be large.\nObserve that \\[\nD_i=\\frac{r_i^2}{p} \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\hat\\epsilon_i\\right)}=\\frac{r_i^2}{p} \\frac{h_{i i}}{1-h_{i i}}, \\quad i=1,2, \\ldots, n,\\] where it is important to recall that \\(r_i\\) is the studentized residual. Now, the quantity \\(\\frac{h_{i i}}{1-h_{i i}}\\) can be shown to be the distance from the vector \\(x_i\\) to the centroid of the remaining data. Therefore, \\(D_i\\) is the product of outlyingness in both the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) directions. We may also write \\(D_i\\) as \\[D_i=\\frac{\\left\\lVert\\hat{y}_{(i)}-\\hat{y}\\right\\rVert^2}{p MSE},\\] which allows for the interpretation: The Cook’s distance of the \\(i\\)th point is the normalized distance between the fitted value with and without point \\(i\\).\n\n#cut off\ncooks.distance(a)\n\n           1            2            3            4            5            6 \n0.1708029420 0.2516095165 0.0180669722 0.0009569213 0.0011772793 0.2002829110 \n           7 \n3.3311562309 \n\ncooks.distance(a)&gt;1\n\n    1     2     3     4     5     6     7 \nFALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE \n\ndf=data.frame(cbind(y,x))\ndf[cooks.distance(a)&gt;1,]\n\n   y   x\n7 15 2.5",

    "section": "7.3 Data depth functions",
    "text": "7.3 Data depth functions\nA more modern approach and nonparametric approach to outlier detection is through data depth. A data depth function gives meaning to centrality, order and outlyingness in spaces beyond \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). A data depth function is a function which takes a sample and a point, and returns how central the point is, with respect to the sample. Depth functions can be written as \\({\\textrm{D}}\\colon \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times \\text{Sample} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^+\\). There are different definitions of depth, so I will give a few.\nLet \\(S^{d-1}= \\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\colon \\left\\lVert x\\right\\rVert=1\\}\\) be the set of unit vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\), let \\(\\mathbb{X}_{n}=\\{(Y_1,X_{1,1},\\ldots,X_{1,p-1}),\\ldots, (Y_n,X_{n,1},\\ldots,X_{n,p-1})\\}\\), let \\(\\mathbb{X}_{n}^\\top u\\) be \\(\\mathbb{X}_{n}\\) projected onto \\(u\\in S^{d-1}\\) and let \\(\\widehat F_u\\) be the empirical CDF with respect to \\(\\mathbb{X}_{n}^\\top u\\).\n\nThe halfspace depth \\({\\textrm{D}}_H\\) of a point \\(x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) with respect to a distribution \\(F\\) over \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) is \\[\n{\\textrm{D}}_H(x;F)=\\inf_{u\\in S^{d-1}} \\widehat F_u(x^\\top u)\\wedge (1-F_u(x^\\top u))=\\inf_{u\\in S^{d-1}}\nF_u(x^\\top u).\n\\]\n\n\nGiven a translation and scale equivariant location estimate \\(\\mu\\) and a translation and scale invariant scale estimate \\(\\sigma\\), the outlyingness at \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) is defined as \\[O(x)=\\sup _{u\\in S^{d-1}} \\frac{\\left|x^\\top u-\\mu(\\mathbb{X}_{n}^\\top u)\\right|}{\\sigma(\\mathbb{X}_{n}^\\top u)}.\\] Define projection depth as \\[{\\textrm{D}}_p(x)=(1+O(x))^{-1}.\\]\n\nIn order to detect outliers, we look for observations that have low depth. See, continuing our toy example:\n\n# install.packages('ddalpha')\ndepths=ddalpha::depth.projection(cbind(x,y),cbind(x,y))\ndepths\n\n[1] 0.2764090105 0.2552720744 0.5000000000 0.9737543285 0.9730469270\n[6] 0.3389544152 0.0007989515\n\ndepths&lt;0.015\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\nExample 7.1 Recall example Example 6.6.

    "title": "8  Multicollinearity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "8.1 Multicollinearity and the problems it creates\nA serious problem that may dramatically impact the usefulness of a regression model is multicollinearity, or near-linear dependence among the regression variables. That is multicollinearity refers to near-linear dependence among the regressors. The regressors are the columns of the \\(X\\) matrix, so clearly an exact linear dependence among the regressors would result in a singular \\(X^\\top X\\). This will impact our ability to estimate \\(\\beta\\).\nTo elaborate, assume that the regressor variables and the response have been centered and scaled to unit length. The matrix \\(X^\\top X\\) is then a \\(p\\times p\\) correlation matrix (of the vector of regressors) and \\(X^\\top Y\\) is the vector of correlations between the regressors and response. Recall that a set of vectors \\(v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\) are linearly dependent if there exists \\(c\\neq 0\\) such that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^nc_iv_i=0\\). If the columns of \\(X\\) are linearly dependent, then \\(X^\\top X\\) is not invertible! We say there is multicollinearity if there exists \\(c\\neq 0\\) such that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^nc_iv_i&lt;\\epsilon\\) for some small \\(\\epsilon\\).\nMulticollinearity results in large variances and covariances for the least - squares estimators of the regression coefficients. Let \\(A=(X^\\top X)^{-1}\\), where the regressors have been centered and scaled to unit length. That is, columns \\(2,\\ldots,p\\) of \\(X\\) have their mean subtracted and are divided by their respective norms. Then \\[A_{jj}=(1-R^2_j)^{-1},\\] where \\(R^2_j\\) is the coefficient of multiple determination from the regression of \\(X_j\\) on the remaining \\(p - 1\\) regressor variables. Now, recall that \\({\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_j\\right]=A_{jj}\\sigma^2\\). What happens when the correlation is approximately 1 between \\(X_j\\) and another regressor? It is easy to see that the the variance of coefficient \\(j\\) goes to \\(\\infty\\) as \\({\\textrm{corr}}\\left[X_j,X_i\\right]\\to 1\\).\nThis huge variance results in large magnitude of the least squares estimators of the regression coefficients. We have that \\({\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\left\\lVert\\hat\\beta-\\beta\\right\\rVert^2\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^p\\sigma^2 {\\textrm{Var}}\\left[\\hat\\beta_i\\right]=\\sigma^2 \\mathop{\\mathrm{trace}}(X^\\top X)^{-1}\\). Recall! \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{trace}}(A)\\) is the sum of its eigenvalues. If \\(X^\\top X\\) has near linearly dependent columns, then some of the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_p\\) will be near 0 (why?). Thus, \\[{\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\left\\lVert\\hat\\beta-\\beta\\right\\rVert^2\\right]=\\sigma^2\\mathop{\\mathrm{trace}}(X^\\top X)^{-1}=\\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^p\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i}.\\] We can also show that \\[{\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\hat{\\beta}^{\\top} \\hat{\\beta}\\right]=\\beta^{\\top} \\beta+\\sigma^2 \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(X^{\\top} X\\right)^{-1},\\] which gives the same interpretation.\nWe can also observe this empirically.\n# Let's simulate data from a regression model with highly correlated regressors. \nsimulate_coef=function(){\n  n=100\n  X=rnorm(n)\n  X2=2*X+rnorm(n,0,0.01)\n  Y=1+2*X+X2*2+rnorm(n)\n  return(coef(lm(Y~X+X2)))\n}\n\n# See the HUGE variance in the estimated coefficients? 0 this is from MCL!\nCF=replicate(1000,simulate_coef())\nhist(CF[1,])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(CF[2,])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(CF[3,])\nIt is easy to see from this analysis that multicollinearity is a serious problem, and we should check for it in regression modelling.",

    "section": "8.2 Multicollinearity Diagnostics",
    "text": "8.2 Multicollinearity Diagnostics\nWe need some diagnostics to detect multicollinearity. The first of which is the correlation matrix, which is good for detecting pairwise correlations, but not so much for more complicated dependencies! To correct this, a popular diagnostic is the variance inflation factor (VIF): these are the diagonals of \\((X^\\top X)^{-1}\\). A VIF that exceeds 3, 5 or 10 is an indication that the associated regression coefficients are poorly estimated because of multicollinearity. The variance inflation factor can be written as \\((1-R^2_j)^{-1}\\), where \\(R^2_j\\) is the coefficient of determination obtained from regressing \\(x_j\\) on the other regressor variables. For categorical variables, we may look at their VIF together, instead of for the individual dummy variables. This is done via the generalized VIF (GVIF), which was developed by our very own Georges Monette and John Fox (Fox and Monette 1992). We can consider the \\((GVIF^(1/(2\\text{number of dummy variables})))\\). This is computed automatically in R.\nOne can also look at the eigenvalues of \\(X^\\top X\\), where the regressors are centered and normalized to unit length. If the eigenvalues are small, this indicates multicollinearity. One metric computed from the eigenvalues is the condition number of \\(X^\\top X\\): \\(\\kappa=\\max \\lambda_j/\\min \\lambda_j\\), where the regressors are centered and normalized to unit length. Condition numbers between 100 and 1000 imply moderate to strong multicollinearity, and if \\(\\kappa\\) exceeds 1000, severe multicollinearity is indicated. Diagonalizing via \\(X^\\top X=\\Lambda D \\Lambda^\\top\\) yields the eigenvectors, which help us determine the exact dependence between variables is. You can check the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues. Components that are large in the eigenvector indicate that that variable is contributing to the multicollinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile the method of least squares will generally produce poor estimates of the individual model parameters when strong multicollinearity is present, this does not necessarily imply that the fitted model is a poor predictor.\n\nIf predictions are confined to regions of the \\(X\\)-space where the multicollinearity holds approximately, the fitted model often produces satisfactory predictions.\nThe linear combinations \\(X\\beta\\) may be estimated well, even if \\(\\beta\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.1 Recall example Example 6.6.

    "text": "9.1 Variable Selection\nIn the preceding lessons we have assumed that the regressor variables included in the model are known to be important. Our focus was on techniques to ensure that the functional form of the model was correct and that the underlying assumptions were not violated. In previous lessons, we have employed the classical approach to regression model selection, which assumes that we have a very good idea of the basic form of the model and that we know all (or nearly all) of the regressors that should be used.\nOur approach so far can be summarized as follows:\nIn many problems the analyst has a rather large pool of possible candidate regressors, of which only a few are likely to be important. Finding an appropriate subset of regressors for the model is often called the variable selection problem .\nBuilding a regression model that includes only a subset of the available regressors involves two conflicting objectives:\nTherefore, we seek a model that is a compromise between these two objectives. There are several algorithms that can be used for variable selection, and these procedures frequently specify different subsets of the candidate regressors as best.\nVariable selection is often developed in an idealized setting: Assumed that the correct functional specification of the regressors is known, and no outliers are present. In practice – it’s messy. Residual analysis is useful in revealing functional forms of regressors that might be investigated, in pointing out new candidate regressors, and for identifying defects in the data such as outliers. The effect of influential observations should also be determined. Although ideally these problems should be solved simultaneously, an iterative approach is often employed, in which (1) a particular variable selection strategy is employed and then (2) the resulting subset model is checked for correct functional specification, outliers, and influential observations. This may indicate that step 1 must be repeated. Several iterations may be required to produce an adequate model.\nNone of the variable selection procedures described are guaranteed to produce the best model for a given data set. In fact, there is usually not a single best model but rather several equally good ones. Variable selection algorithms are heavily algorithmic so it is tempting to place a lot of confidence in the results of a particular procedure. Beware of this - experience, professional judgment and subjective considerations are also critical to the variable selection problem. Variable selection procedures should be used in conjunction with these.\nTwo key aspects of the variable selection problem are:",

Consequently, one criterion for selection of an optimum subset model is to choose the model that has a maximum \\(\\bar R^2\\). In addition, note that maximizing \\(\\bar R^2\\) is equivalent to choosing the model with the minimum \\(MSE\\).\n\n# R2 adjusted \nr2=c()\nfor(i in 1:length(var_list)){\n  vars=c(var_list[1:i],\"Sale_price\")\n  model2=lm(Sale_price~.,df2[,vars])\n  sm=summary(model2)\n  r2=c(r2,sm$adj.r.squared)\n}\nplot(r2,type='l',lwd=2,ylab=\"R2\",xlab=\"# variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar_list[1:6]\n\n[1] \"District\"   \"Extwall\"    \"Stories\"    \"Year_Built\" \"Fin_sqft\"  \n[6] \"Units\"     \n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Mallows \\(C_k\\) criterion\nConsider the complete model: \\[\n(C)\\ Y = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 X_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\n\\] and a reduced model with \\((k-1)\\) explanatory variables \\[\nY = \\beta_1 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_{k} X_{k} + \\epsilon.\n\\] Mallows (1973) defined the \\(C_k\\) statistic as \\[\nC_k = \\frac{SSE_R}{MSE_C} - (n - 2k)\n\\] where \\(k\\) is the number of columns in \\(X\\) in the reduced model.\nObserve that if \\(k = p\\) then \\[C_k = C_{p} = dfE_C - [n - 2p] = p = k.\\]\nLet \\(\\operatorname{Bias}={\\textrm{E}}\\left[\\hat Y_i\\right]-{\\textrm{E}}\\left[Y_i\\right]\\) where \\(\\hat Y_i\\) are generated from the reduced model. It can be shown that \\[E\\left[C_k \\mid \\operatorname{Bias}=0\\right]=k.\\] That is, if the regression model based on the subset of \\(k-1\\) predictors is unbiased, then we expect \\(C_k\\) to be roughly \\(k\\). In addition, if there is bias, then \\(E[C_k ]&gt;k\\). Therefore, it is suggested that from all possible models, we choose the model with \\(C_k\\) close to \\(k\\) and \\(C_k \\leq k\\). This is a littble bit subjective: For example, the smallest \\(C_k\\) is \\(C_4 = 4.1\\) and the next smallest is \\(C_5 = 4.7\\). \\(C_4\\) is smallest but \\(C_4&gt;4\\) – the model may be biased.

    "section": "9.5 Algorithms for model selection",
    "text": "9.5 Algorithms for model selection\nWe now discuss algorithms which auto select the “best” model.\n\n9.5.1 All subsets regression\nAll subsets regression, also known as best subsets regression, is one way to select the best subset of regressors. This technique proceeds as the name implies - it involves evaluating all possible combinations of regressors to identify the model that best fits the data according to a chosen criterion. For instance, if the criterion is AIC, then we may compute the AIC for all possible \\(2^p\\) models. All subsets regression would choose the model with the lowest AIC. Any of the four criterion (AIC, BIC, Mallows \\(C_k\\) or adjusted \\(R^2\\)) can be used for all subsets regression.\nAll subsets regression considers all possible subsets of regressors, ensuring that the best model is not missed by the algorithm. However, this has some downsides. First, it can be very computationally intensive for data sets with a large number of regressors. Second, if not properly controlled, examining many models can lead to overfitting, especially with small data sets.\nOverfitting is when the model fits the data set so well, that it misses the underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This results in a model that fits the data set well, but performs poorly at predicting new, unseen data due to its overly complex structure.\nWe can observe this in the example below:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nset.seed(4265)\n\n# Generate sample data\nn = 50\nx = runif(n, min = 0, max = 10)\ny = 1 + x + rnorm(n, sd = 5)\n\n# Create a data frame\ndata = data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(data,pch=22,bg=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# complexity of the model \ncomplexity=9\n\n# Fit a linear regression model\nlinear_model = lm(y ~ x, data = data)\n\n# Fit a polynomial regression model (degree = complexity) This model has more terms. \npoly_model = lm(y ~ poly(x, complexity), data = data)\n\n# Make predictions\nlinear_predictions = predict(linear_model, data)\npoly_predictions = predict(poly_model, data)\n\n# Calculate mean squared error (MSE)\nlinear_mse = mean((data$y - linear_predictions)^2)\npoly_mse = mean((data$y - poly_predictions)^2)\n\n# Print MSE values\ncat(\"Linear Model MSE:\", linear_mse, \"\\n\")\n\nLinear Model MSE: 24.03022 \n\ncat(\"Polynomial Model MSE:\", poly_mse, \"\\n\")\n\nPolynomial Model MSE: 19.69118 \n\n# Notice how the squared error is lower for the more complex model?\n\n\n# Plot the results - this is GG plot, another way to plot in R\nggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\", formula = y ~ x) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\", formula = y ~ poly(x,complexity)) +\n  labs(title = \"Linear vs. Polynomial Regression (Degree 9)\",\n       x = \"X\", y = \"Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate new data from the same process\nN = 500\nxx = runif(n, min = 0, max = 10)\nyy = 1 + x + rnorm(n, sd = 5)\nnd = data.frame('x'=xx,'y'=yy)\n\ngen_linear_predictions = predict(linear_model, nd)\ngen_poly_predictions = predict(poly_model, nd)\n\n# Calculate mean squared error (MSE)\ngen_linear_mse = mean((data$y - gen_linear_predictions)^2)\ngen_poly_mse = mean((data$y - gen_poly_predictions)^2)\n\n# Print MSE values\ncat(\"Linear Model MSE:\", gen_linear_mse, \"\\n\")\n\nLinear Model MSE: 45.06416 \n\ncat(\"Polynomial Model MSE:\", gen_poly_mse, \"\\n\")\n\nPolynomial Model MSE: 50.40172 \n\n# Notice how the generalized error is lower for the linear model?\n\nAbove, we fit two models to the data. One that allows for polynomial functions of degree at most 9 (not just linear functions), and one that only allows linear functions. It is clear that the polynomial model has a lower error on the data set at hand. However, when we generate new data from the same process, the polynomial model has a much higher error. This is an example of overfitting - the complex model does not generalize well beyond the current data set.\n\nExample 9.6 Use the NFL data from the textbook - Perform all subsets regression with each of the metrics described above.\n\n\n# install.packages('leaps')\n\nall=leaps::regsubsets(Wins~PassY+PuntA+FGP+TurnD+PenY+RushDiff+ORY+OPY,data=df,nvmax=10,method='exhaustive')\n\n# 2^8\n\nplot(all,scale='r2')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='adjr2')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='Cp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='bic')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaps package allows us to do all subsets regression. We see that (with the exception of the \\(R\\)-squared) the best model under all criterion contains passing yards, rushing yard differential, and opponent passing yards.\nWe can do the same thing on the real estate data:\n\n# install.packages('leaps')\n# If you run this, you will get the following error: \n# all=leaps::regsubsets(Sale_price~ District +  Extwall +     \n#             Stories  +    Year_Built  + Fin_sqft  +   \n#             Units   +     Bdrms   +    \n#             Fbath  +    Lotsize   + Sale_date +District*Lotsize,data=df2,nvmax=10,method='exhaustive')\n# \"Error in leaps.exhaustive(a, really.big) : Exhaustive search will be S L O W, must specify really.big=T\"\n# This shows how this can quickly become computationally intensive\n\n# You will see that running the following code takes very long!\nall=leaps::regsubsets(Sale_price~ District +  Extwall +\n            Stories  +    Year_Built  + Fin_sqft  +\n            Units   +     Bdrms   +\n            Fbath  +    Lotsize   + Sale_date+District*Lotsize,data=df2,nvmax=10,really.big=T,method='exhaustive')\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='r2')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='adjr2')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='Cp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(all,scale='bic')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selected models appear fairly sparse!\n\n\n9.5.2 Forward selection\nForward selection is another common algorithm used to select the best model. It involves adding regressors one by one until adding more regressors becomes unhelpful. Essentially, we find the most “significant” regressor to be added to the model, and add it if it is “significant enough”. We keep adding regressors, until none are significant enough. However, forward selection is “greedy”, in the sense that it does not consider all possible subsets of regressors. This means that it is possible that the “best” model is missed by the algorithm.\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nChoose \\(\\alpha_{entry}\\), which is the significance level for a regressor to enter the model. Set the current model to be \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon\\).\nAmong all regressors \\(X_i\\) not in the current model, test \\(H_0: X_i\\) not entered versus \\(H_a: X_i\\) entered.\nChoose the covariate with smallest \\(p\\)-value, i.e. the most likely \\(X_i\\) to be entered. Say the \\(p\\)-value for testing \\(H_0: \\beta_1 =0\\) is the smallest.\nIf the chosen \\(p\\)-value is \\(\\geq  \\alpha_{entry}\\), then \\(X_1\\) is not entered, and the current model is chosen as the final model and the process terminates. Otherwise, \\(X_1\\) is entered and the new current model is set to the current model, with the addition of \\(X_1\\).\nReturn to step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that once an explanatory variable is entered, it will never leave the model.\n\nExample 9.7 Suppose that we have 3 explanatory variables and \\(\\alpha_{entry}\\) is chosen to be 0.05.

As you can see, the chosen model is easily affected by the chosen \\(\\alpha_{entry}\\) value.\n\n\n9.5.3 Backward elimination\nIn Backward elimination, we start with the largest model, i.e., the one with all of the regressors, and eliminate regressors one by one until nothing can be eliminated. Like forward selection, backward selection is also greedy, and therefore, suffers from the same drawbacks.\nFor \\(p-1\\) regressors, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nChoose: \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\), which is the significance level for an explanatory variable to stay in the model. Set the current model to be \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_{p-1} X_{p-1} + \\epsilon\\).\nTest \\(H_0: X_i\\) eliminated versus \\(H_a: X_i\\) not eliminated, i.e. \\(H_0: \\beta_i =0\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_i \\ne 0\\) with respect to the current model.\nChoose the regressor with the largest \\(p\\)-value – i.e., the most likely \\(X_i\\) to be eliminated. Say \\(p\\)-value for testing \\(H_0: \\beta_p =0\\) is the largest.\nIf the chosen \\(p\\)-value is \\(&lt;  \\alpha_{stay}\\), then \\(X_p\\) is not eliminated, and the chosen model is the current model and the process terminates. Otherwise, \\(X_p\\) is eliminated and the current model is set to be the old current model, with \\(X_p\\) removed.\nIf there are no regressors in the current model, terminate. Otherwise, go back to step 2.\n\n\nExample 9.8 Suppose that we have 3 explanatory variables and \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\) is chosen to be 0.05. The following is how we would proceed.\n\nThe current model is \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_3 + \\epsilon\\).\nIteration 1:\n\n\n\n\\(H_a:\\)\n\\(p\\)-value\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n0.0176\n\n\n\\(\\beta_2 \\ne 0\\)\n0.05627\n\n\n\\(\\beta_3 \\ne 0\\)\n0.36145\n\n\n\nSince 0.36145 is the largest \\(p\\)-value and it is greater than \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\), the current model is set to be \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon\\), and we continue to the next iteration.\nIteration 2:\nModel is \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\\(H_a:\\)\n\\(p\\)-value\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n0.00139\n\n\n\\(\\beta_2 \\ne 0\\)\n0.01330\n\n\n\nSince 0.01330 is the smallest \\(p\\)-value and it is less than \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\), the final model is \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon\\), and the process terminates.\nIf \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\) is chosen to be 0.01, then we will continue the process and eventually, the chosen model is \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon\\). Again, the chosen model is easily affected by the chosen \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\) value.\nIn forward selection, once a regressor is entered, it will be in the final model. In backward elimination, once a regressor is eliminated, it will not be in the final model. A combination of these two processes, that allows for variables to enter and exit the model is called stepwise Regression.\n\n\n9.5.4 Stepwise regression\nIn stepwise regression, we start the model from smallest model, \\(Y=\\beta_0+\\epsilon\\), and we keep adding and eliminating regressors one by one such that added regressors can be eliminated later and eliminated regressors can be added later. Like forward selection and backward selection, stepwise regression is also greedy, and therefore, suffers from the same drawbacks.\nFor \\(p-1\\) regressors, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nChoose: \\(\\alpha_{enter}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{stay}\\). Set the current model to be \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon\\).\nSet the old model to be the current model. Perform steps 2-4 of forward selection.\nSuppose in the previous step, \\(X_1\\) was added to the current model. Next, with the current model, apply steps 2-5 of backward elimination.\nIf \\(X_1\\) is eliminated in backward elimination, then do not remove \\(X_1\\) from the current model and set the current model to be the final model. The process then terminates. If the current model equals the old model, terminate. Otherwise, go back to step 2.\n\nThe stopping rule for stepwise regression is when we run into infinite loop (the same variable being added and eliminated) OR when we have nothing to add and nothing to eliminate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nOne way to avoid the infinite loop is to choose \\(\\alpha_{stay} \\neq  \\alpha_{entry}\\).\nSome books suggest “easy to enter” and “tough to eliminate” strategy for selecting \\(\\alpha_{stay},  \\alpha_{entry}\\) but there is no strict rule.\nR is using the AIC criterion for entering and eliminating, rather than the \\(F\\) test. This is also acceptable.\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.9 Recall the real estate example - Example 6.6. Run forward selection, backward selection and stepwise regression using AIC as the criterion, including all regressors.

    "text": "9.6 Cross Validation\nWe may be mainly interested in predictive performance of our model. To assess the performance of our model’s predictive ability, it would be ideal to test its ability to predict the response. We could test our model out on our dataset, but our model has already `seen’ this dataset. Previously, we saw that the model’s predictive ability on the dataset at hand does not neccessarily mean it will output good predictions for new data from the same population. This means that the predictive ability of the model on the current observations won’t reflect the model’s ability to predict observations it hasn’t seen. It would be ideal to have some new data in order to measure predictive performance, but it is also ideal to use all data in building the model. Cross validation allows us to obtain an estimate of a given model’s out of sample predictive performance.\nCross-validation is a technique where we repeatedly fit our model using a subset of the dataset and then compute its predictive performance on the complementary subset of the dataset. We then average these predictive performances and use this to estimate our model’s overall predictive performance.\nHere is an overview of the algorithm:\n\nPartition the data \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) into \\(k\\) groups of size about \\(n/k\\) uniformly at random. Denoted \\(\\mathbb{Z}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbb{Z}_k\\).\nFor each; \\(\\mathbb{Z}_j\\), fit the regression model on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash \\mathbb{Z}_j\\).\nFor each observation in the left out group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_j\\), use the previously computed model to produce a prediction \\(\\hat Y_{j,1},\\ldots, \\hat Y_{j,n/k}\\), resulting in \\(n/k\\) predictions.\nFor each prediction, compute the predictive error \\((y_{j,i}- \\hat y_{j,i})^2\\) (Can also use absolute error).\nRepeat steps 2-3 for each group \\(1,\\ldots,k\\).\nAverage the \\(n\\) predictive errors.\nRepeat for all candidate models and choose the model with the lowest prediction error.\n\nTo highlight the choice of \\(k\\), we say \\(k\\)-fold Cross Validation – Each of the \\(k\\) subsets are known as folds. What do we choose for \\(k\\)? LOOCV (Leave One Out Cross Validation) is a popular technique. Here, \\(k=n\\). This is where each run, one observation is left out of the model. This gives a low bias, but high variation estimate of the prediction error. It also has a high run time. As a result, often, \\(k\\) is taken to be 5 or 10. Taking lower values of \\(k\\) gives a result similar to that of splitting the data into training and test sets, while higher values of \\(k\\) gives a result similar to LOOCV. The choice of the number of folds in cross validation is a bias-variance tradeoff: too few folds may result in high bias, while too many folds may result in high variance. (This is why \\(k\\) is taken between 1 and \\(n\\).)\n\nExample 9.11 Using the real estate data, run cross validation in a forward selection manner.

    "text": "10.1 \\(M\\)-estimators\n\\(M\\)-estimators are a group of estimators which can be defined as minimizers of cost functions. (The \\(M\\) stands for minimizers.) We can define an error function \\(\\rho\\) as a function such that \\(\\rho(|x|)\\) is non-negative, non-decreasing and \\(\\rho(0)=0\\). We can then define the \\(M\\)-estimator with error function \\(\\rho\\) as \\[\\hat\\beta=\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_\\beta C_\\rho(\\beta)=\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n\\rho(Y_i-\\beta^\\top X_i)=\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n\\rho(\\hat\\epsilon_i(\\beta)),\\] where \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i(\\beta)=Y_i-\\beta^\\top X_i\\). Note that for arbitrary \\(\\rho\\), the above may not have a unique minimizer, which may be problematic for computational algorithms and theoretical analysis. An \\(M\\)-estimator is an alternative to the OLS estimator. The idea is to define \\(\\rho\\) so that large residuals \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i(\\beta)\\) do not contribute more than they should to the cost function. To elaborate, we would like \\(\\rho(\\hat\\epsilon_i(\\beta))\\) to be somewhat large if \\(\\hat\\epsilon_i(\\beta)\\) is large, because that signals that the model defined by \\(\\beta\\) does not fit the data well at that point. On the other hand, if observation \\(i\\) is an outlier, than we don’t want to try too hard to make the model fit that point.\nOne drawback of \\(M\\)-estimators is that they are not necessarily scale invariant. For example, we have that \\[Y=X\\beta+\\epsilon\\implies aY=aX\\beta+a\\epsilon.\\] Therefore, it is natural that we would expect the estimation procedure applied to \\((X,Y)\\) to produce the same estimator for \\(\\beta\\) as the estimation procedure applied to \\((aX,aY)\\). Unfortunately, this is not always the case for \\(M\\)-estimators. One way to remedy this is to obtain a (robust) scale estimate \\(s\\), and then define the estimate as \\[\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n\\rho(\\frac{Y_i-\\beta^\\top X_i}{s}).\\] For example, the median absolute deviation divided by \\(0.6745\\) is often used.",

This loss provides a compromise between least squares and absolute loss, offering robustness to outliers while retaining efficiency for small residuals.\n\\[ \\rho(u) = \\begin{cases}\nu^2 / 2 & \\text{if } |u| \\leq \\delta \\\\\n\\delta(|u| - \\delta/2) & \\text{if } |u| &gt; \\delta\n\\end{cases}, \\qquad\\qquad \\psi(u)= \\begin{cases}\nu & \\text{if } |u| \\leq \\delta \\\\\n\\delta \\times sign(u) & \\text{if } |u| &gt; \\delta\n\\end{cases}. \\]\nThe next three losses offer even more robustness to outliers, potentially at the cost of efficiency.\n\n\n10.2.3 Ramsay’s \\(E\\) Function\nRamsay’s \\(E\\) function is used to give higher influence to residuals near zero and less influence to large residuals.\n\\[ \\rho(u) = \\frac{1-(1+\\delta |u|)\\exp(-\\delta |u|)}{\\delta ^2},\\qquad\\qquad \\psi(u)=sign(u)\\exp(-\\delta |u|)/\\delta.\\]\n\n\n10.2.4 Andrews’ Wave Function\nAndrews’ wave function is a loss function that limits the influence of large residuals more than Huber’s loss.\n\\[ \\rho(u) = \\delta \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{u}{\\delta}\\right)\\right),\\qquad\\qquad \\psi(u)=\\frac{\\sin(u/\\delta)}{u/\\delta}. \\]\n\n\n10.2.5 Tukey’s Loss\nTukey’s loss function, also known as the biweight loss function, completely cuts off the influence of residuals beyond a certain point.\n\\[ \\rho(u) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{c^2}{6} \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{u}{c}\\right)^2\\right)^3\\right] & \\text{if } |u| \\leq c \\\\\n\\frac{c^2}{6} & \\text{if } |u| &gt; c\n\\end{cases},\\qquad\\qquad \\psi(u)=\\begin{cases}\nu \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{u}{c}\\right)^2\\right)^2 & \\text{if } |u| \\leq c \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |u| &gt; c\n\\end{cases}.\\]\nLet’s graph each of these functions:\n\n# Define the least squares loss function\nleast_squares_loss &lt;- function(u) {\n  return(u^2/2)\n}\n\n# Define Huber's loss function\nhubers_loss &lt;- function(u, delta=2) {\n  return(ifelse(abs(u) &lt;= delta, 0.5 * u^2, delta * (abs(u) - 0.5 * delta)))\n}\n\n# Define Ramsay's E function\nramsays_e_function &lt;- function(u, delta=0.3) {\n  return((1-(1+delta*abs(u))*exp(-delta*abs(u)))/(delta^2))\n}\n\n# Define Andrews' wave function\nandrews_wave_function &lt;- function(u, delta=1.339) {\n  if(abs(u / delta)&lt;pi)\n    return(delta * (1 - cos(u / delta)))\n  else\n    return(NA)\n}\n\n\n# Define Tukey's loss function\ntukeys_loss &lt;- function(u, c=3) {\n  abs_u &lt;- abs(u)\n  return(ifelse(abs_u &lt;= c, (c^2 / 6) * (1 - (1 - (u / c)^2)^3), c^2 / 6))\n}\n\n\nu &lt;- seq(-10,10, by = 0.1)\n\nls_loss &lt;- sapply(u,least_squares_loss)\nh_loss &lt;- sapply(u,hubers_loss)\nr_loss &lt;- sapply(u,ramsays_e_function)\na_loss &lt;- sapply(u,andrews_wave_function)\ntukey_loss &lt;- sapply(u,tukeys_loss)\n\npar(lwd=3)\n# Plotting example losses for visualization\nplot(u, ls_loss, type = \"l\", col = \"blue\", ylim = c(0, 6), ylab = \"Loss\", xlab = \"u\", main = \"Loss Functions\")\nlines(u, h_loss, col = \"red\")\nlines(u, r_loss, col = \"green\")\nlines(u, a_loss, col = \"purple\")\nlines(u, tukey_loss, col = \"brown\")\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Least Squares\", \"Huber's\", \"Ramsay's E\", \"Andrews' Wave\",  \"Tukey's\"), \n       col = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\", \"purple\", \"brown\"), lty = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Zooming in \n\nu &lt;- seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1)\n\nls_loss &lt;- sapply(u,least_squares_loss)\nh_loss &lt;- sapply(u,hubers_loss)\nr_loss &lt;- sapply(u,ramsays_e_function)\na_loss &lt;- sapply(u,andrews_wave_function)\ntukey_loss &lt;- sapply(u,tukeys_loss)\n\npar(lwd=3)\n# Plotting example losses for visualization\nplot(u, ls_loss, type = \"l\", col = \"blue\", ylab = \"Loss\", xlab = \"u\", main = \"Loss Functions\",ylim=c(0,0.5))\nlines(u, h_loss, col = \"red\")\nlines(u, r_loss, col = \"green\")\nlines(u, a_loss, col = \"purple\")\nlines(u, tukey_loss, col = \"brown\")\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Least Squares\", \"Huber's\", \"Ramsay's E\", \"Andrews' Wave\",  \"Tukey's\"), \n       col = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\", \"purple\", \"brown\"), lty = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the cost attributed to large residuals varies based on the chosen function. Most of the functions appear quadratic near 0, but have quite different behaviours at large values. Tukey and Andrew’s Wave function completely cut off the influence of large residuals, which the remaining functions just dampen the influence (except of course, the lease squares loss). Huber’s function and the least squares function are convex functions, which make computation of the minimzer considerably easier. Huber’s function is about as robust as we can be, while still maintaining a convex loss function. Data drawn from distributions with heavy tails (data with many “large” observations) require more robust loss functions, such as the Tukey biweight function.\nThe robustness of a regression procedure can be classified by the behavior of \\(\\psi\\), the derivative of \\(\\rho\\). The \\(\\psi\\) function controls the weight given to each residual and is proportional to a central concept in robustness called the influence function. Unbounded influence functions are not desirable from a robustness perspective, as this means that one corrupted point is able to drag the estimated hyperplane arbitrarily far. The \\(\\psi\\) function for least squares \\(\\rho\\) is unbounded, and thus least squares tends to be “nonrobust” when used with data arising from a heavy - tailed distribution. On the other hand. the Huber loss function has a monotone \\(\\psi\\) function and is not unbounded, making it more robust.\nThe other influence functions actually redescend as the residual becomes larger. Ramsay’s \\(E\\) function is a soft redescender, that is, the \\(\\psi\\) function is approaches zero as \\(|z|\\to\\infty\\). Andrew’s wave function and Tukey loss are hard redescenders. That is, the \\(\\psi\\) function equals zero for sufficiently large \\(|z|\\). Note that the \\(\\rho\\) functions associated with the redescending \\(\\psi\\) functions are nonconvex, and this in theory can cause convergence problems in the iterative estimation procedure.

    "text": "10.3 Computing \\(M\\)-estimators\n\n10.3.1 Iterated re-weighted least squares\nLet \\(\\psi\\) be the derivative of \\(\\rho\\). A common way to compute the minimizer, of \\(C_\\rho(\\beta)\\) is to use iterated re-weighted least squares. First, note that to find the minimizer, of \\(C_\\rho(\\beta)\\), we solve the following system of equations: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{ij} \\psi\\left(\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}\\right)=0, \\quad j=0,1, \\ldots, k.\\] To do this, rewrite \\[\\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i j} \\psi\\left(\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}\\right)\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}\\big /\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}=0\\\\\n&\\text{ or, }\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i j} w_{i,\\beta}\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}=0,\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\[w_{i,\\beta}= \\psi\\left(\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}\\right)\\big /\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta}{s}.\\]\nNext, one will propose an initial estimate of the parameters \\(\\alpha_0\\) and consider \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i j} w_{i, \\alpha_0}(Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\beta)=0.\n\\end{align*}\\] Equivalently, we have \\(X^\\top W_{\\alpha_0} X\\beta=X^\\top W_{\\alpha_0} Y\\), where \\(W_{\\alpha_0}\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) diagonal matrix of “weights” with diagonal elements \\(w_{1, \\alpha_0},\\ldots, w_{n, \\alpha_0}\\). The algorithm proceeds as follows: iteratively compute \\(\\alpha_i=(X^\\top W_{\\alpha_{i-1}} X)^{-1}X^\\top W_{\\alpha_{i-1}} Y\\) until \\(\\left\\lVert\\alpha_i-\\alpha_{i-1}\\right\\rVert&lt;\\epsilon\\) for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n10.3.2 Gradient descent\nWe can also use gradient descent to compute the minimizer, of \\(C_\\rho(\\beta)\\). To do this given a step size \\(\\eta&gt;0\\), iteratively compute \\[\\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{i-1}-\\eta\\times\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} \\psi\\left(\\frac{Y_i-X_i^{\\top} \\alpha_{i-1}}{s}\\right),\\] until \\(\\left\\lVert\\alpha_i-\\alpha_{i-1}\\right\\rVert&lt;\\epsilon\\) for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nExample 10.1 Consider the stack loss data, it records the percentage of stack loss in the operation of a plant that uses the oxidation of ammonia to produce nitric acid. The data set contains four variables and 21 observations.\nVariables - Air.Flow: Flow rate of cooling air (in cubic meters per hour) - Water.Temp: Cooling water inlet temperature (in degrees Celsius) - Acid.Conc.: Acid concentration (percentage) - stack.loss: Stack loss (percentage of the ammonia lost)\nRegress stack loss on the remaining variables. Compare various robust regression estimates to the OLS estimates. Add a large outlier and repeat the process.

It already includes many common statistical functions! For most common distributions there are functions for the pdf, cdf, inverse cdf as well as one to get a sample from that distribution. The syntax is in the format: dDistName(x,parameters), pDistName(x,parameters), qDistName(x,parameters) and rDistName(x,parameters) respectively.

A simple example…\n\njim&lt;-\"nice\"\n\nif(jim==\"nice\"){\n  alice=\"nice\"\n}\n\nPlacing an else{some code} after the if statement will execute the code in it’s block if the code in the above if statement was not executed. The if and else must be in the same block so I have surrounded them in curly brackets.\n\njim&lt;-\"nice\"\n##same block\n{\nif(jim==\"nice\"){\n  alice=\"nice\"\n}\nelse{\n  alice=\"not nice\"\n}\n  alice\n}\n\n[1] \"nice\"\n\njim&lt;-\"mean\"\n##same block\n{\nif(jim==\"nice\"){\n  alice=\"nice\"\n}\nelse{\n  alice=\"not nice\"\n}\n  alice\n}\n\n[1] \"not nice\"\n\n\nYou may also use else if(boolean){block}, which executes it’s block if the above (else) if statement(s) did not execute.
